# Overview

Our design philosophy is built on a set of fundamental principles and beliefs that guide our approach to creating meaningful, effective, and inclusive design solutions. We believe that design is not about aesthetics, but about creating experiences that connect people with ideas, products, and services in a meaningful way.

At the core of our philosophy is the idea that the message is the message. We believe in designing solutions that prioritize the message over the medium, and that enable free expression and protect privacy. We strive to create designs that are functional and utilitarian, rather than driven by trends or fashion.

Our design philosophy also centers around the belief that design is a powerful tool for social and political activism. We see design as a form of activism that has the potential to inspire change, promote social justice, and resist dominant ideologies. Our design philosophy is communal, cooperative, and owned equally by all. We strive to create designs that are censorship-resistant and protect the privacy of users.

In creating our designs, we believe in the power of modularity and scalability to foster collaboration and diversity. We prioritize solutions that are accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of their technical expertise, physical abilities, or other circumstances. By being transparent and open about our design choices and processes, we aim to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and is not excluded based on any aspect of their identity or situation.

Our design philosophy is not about creating beautiful designs, but about creating designs that have meaning, purpose, and impact. We believe that design can change the world, and we strive to create designs that do just that.
