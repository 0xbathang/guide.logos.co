**How are we differentiated from other movements?**

We are a bi-product of Ethereum and Bitcoin. We are political, we are non compromising in our technology. We believe in the network state, we see ourselves as the neocypherpunk movement.  

We have roots in cypherpunk culture / libertarianism, We are not a tech company, we dont seek funding. We see digital tools as public goods as a community user own soverign network.

For Logos, extend the ideas behind blockchains do, corruption resistant, fiscal policies, network state, poltiical statements, create literal  self sovernign state network.

We have the same ethos as Bitcoin but a more programmible language. We want to avoid the modern lliberal vibes Ethereum puts out.

Its not possible to lobby for crypto in our existing space due to flaws in the nation state and the monopoly on violence. We believe consesnsus algortihms can restore order to the people by way of a part time parliment.

We first and foremost a modular multichain ecosystem solution and at same time we are trying to advance the technologies to create a better parallel system to live in, a better social fabric.

This is an alternative to the nation state as a network state tapping into the soverign individual, these are ideas that existed in early Ethereum. We want to revisit that, I think many of the early pioneers in the space feel the same, we see this as a private version of Ethereum.

Specifically, VC coins have entered this space but they are only viewing as a technology and a business right and they don't really understand how to make software. 

Solana, for example has gone down for 72 hours, because they only made one client. that's completely antithetical to what we're trying to build like it's supposed to be these user own self sovereign systems. 

That in basically declaring independence in cyberspace, according to that manifesto, and that's really what's happening. Whereas we have these roots in in the Cypherpunk culture in hierarchy and libertarianism, essentially. Then when it comes to Ethereum, They are trying to be remain apolitical, a. type of modern, liberal community which struggle defining their culture

 So we're a community and we're trying to build this as a public good. And it's really about a user own self sovereign network that we're trying to create. And Ethereum, is trying to be this sort of like it's trying to be a political or and just a technology. The and it's largely more this sort of modern liberals community that they have, so and the problem with that is, is that Ethereum hasn't tried to define its culture or what it's about. It's great because it becomes like a platform for anyone. 

But now you see, the World Economic Forum is one of the members of the Ethereum foundation is mega Yuichi or whatever is a wealth member. And now is seeing that crypto lobby in the US with Coinbase and other projects. It's for DeFi right but they also have a wealth member in there, right? So it's kind of turning into a way to capture and compete against Bitcoin, but it's very much integrated with existing legal systems and that sort of thing. And so, Ethereum has kind of lost that.

Its roots to a certain extent, right? And when it comes to Bitcoin, what's great about Bitcoin is that it is very much like there's a strong community there, They understand the problems of sovereign debts and escaping the fiat system. They understand the problems of soverign debt and the fiat system escape. There is a large Chrisitian infleunce present there. But overall, Bitcoin is stagnant due to being imprgrammible leaving it stagnant

But there's also a very strong sort of like Catholic Christian influence there. Which we don't necessarily want to be part of. The other problem with Bitcoin is it's largely stagnant, they don't change it. It's almost sacrilegious and it's not programmable. So for us, when it comes to Ethereum, what we're actually trying to do is kind of carry on extend the sort of ideas behind what blockchains do they allows you to create these corruption resistant censorship resistant institutions, and we want to take it further than just like in Bitcoin, a separation of state and money and credit fiscal policy that operates independently, we want to actually extend that to be a network statement itself. So we're actually declaring that no, this is a political statement we are trying to create, literally a network state a user own self sovereign network. And what I liked about Ethereum in the early days is it actually provided a complete decentralized technology stack, It was going to have peer to peer private communications. It was going to have decentralized file storage and it was going to have this consensus layer on the blockchain. And we're really taking a lot of those lessons learned and, you know, basically taking the 2014 vision and we're going to do it ourselves. But closer to Bitcoin, whereas Bitcoin, it's kind of stagnating. 

It won't change and we want to do more with it being the same sort of ethos to a certain extent. However, there's a question of what is our culture going to be? Because they're Ethereum, a Apolitical is a lot more open, but it's become, has this kind of council culture vibes to it, there's modern liberal vibes to it and we want to avoid that. 

We want to define what that is, right? there's some ideas that that are worth keeping. But at the same time, it's like no, no, no, no, we don't want to curtail these technologies to the existing systems because it won't work, right, like lobbying, lobbying for crypto in the existing system won't work, because Fiat is so powerful as a control mechanism and so as the nation state, whereas we want to say actually, no, there are flaws in the nation state that we can address with this, this this system. The nation state is based on a monopoly on violence. Whereas what Bitcoin showed us was that this, these consensus algorithms allows us to derive an order through through consensus or a democratically legitimated order. So it's order that's bestowed by the people. And this goes back to one of the earlier distributed systems papers that there is a part time Parliament, and that's what consensus is, it's part time parliament. 

I think I think it does. Well, we're first and foremost, a full stack, full decentralized technology stack, right? So we're providing peer to peer communications. We're providing decentralized file storage, and we're providing a modular multi chain ecosystem or multi chain solution. At the same time, we're trying to advance this technology to create a bit of social fabric or a complete parallel system that you can live in.  

The end goal is that you can live entirely within this system, right? we're providing these governing services we're providing a court system, we're genuinely trying to be an alternative to the to the nation state as a network state, and you can access it anywhere. We also care about self sovereignty of the individual, And we want to tap into that sovereign individual book. 

These are ideas that existed in early Ethereum. But have largely kind of been overshadowed because of Defi and layer twos. Ethereum is trying to scale through layer twos. And because of historical design decisions, it kind of has this EVM and account model which doesn't really work in terms of paralyzation. We can were using a different model entirely, which is like EXO and you can, this is more technical, but it depends is asking this question. Right. But for technical points, like, we'll use as a UT EXO model, you have to provide the state for your transaction to be valid. And that has a whole bunch of benefits, but also some downsides as well from a development standpoint. The other thing is retreating privacy. Seriously, we want to build out this thing called ZKwasm. And that will allow you to have private smart contracts. So then you can bring Zcash into it as well And so Zcash is kind of like a private version of Bitcoin and we are like a private version of Ethereum.

*How are we relevant?*

There's a lot of fear right now. Or a lot of awareness that there is like this deep states, there's the United Nations and the World Economic Forum. And people are scared of this new world order, right. And we want to provide. The West came out with it's 2030 I'll own I'll have no privacy, our own nothing and I'll be happy. And so a lot of people are kind of scared of this narrative and the threat of a new world order or global hegemon coming up, and we want to provide an alternative that that enables freedom of expression. Freedom of speech, enables privacy and has strong property rights. But then we can also say that we want to focus on providing governing services according to a set of well defined principles around how you provide governing services. So I think that's largely why we're relevant and probably a narrative that will continue for the time being, but it also were relevant because we're really pushing the technology in the way that it's kind of meant to be like the idealized version. And a lot of the OG Ethereum people and Bitcoiners are in between Ethereum and Bitcoin. It will appeal to many, it's very much like a sort of Neo Cypherpunk movement that we're trying to create. 

meta narrative - Fear / awareness - around a new world order or nation state

enables privacy, freedom of speech, provide governing services, really pushing technology in the ideal version which it will appeal too neo cypher punk movement

How we prevent being irrelevant?

embody our principles, so to speak. And that informs what the technology does, right? And if you if you fail at the infrastructure of the technology, then nothing else makes sense. And that's kind of what the disillusionment about Ethereum is is that they're making too many concessions on these ideals. That it no longer becomes, it becomes something but it's crypto compatible, rather than like proper crypto.

If you think about it from the progression of thought that kind of came to the status application, the status app exists because we saw WeChat and how it could improve the lives of of the Chinese mainland, small to medium businesses, for example. 

But it has this massive state surveillance apparatus to it. So we're kind of against surveillance, capitalism and those kind of technologies. Because we're really trying to carry on and preserve these western ideals, which is why Logos matters because Logos is about the pursuit of truth and the discourse around it. The pursuit of truth is you having a discourse with different people and you're trying to find out what actually is the real the reality or the truth as far as we know. 

And the app was maybe how we unconsciously saw that. Our civil liberties were kind of dissipating. I basically see it as cultural Marxism is the fundamental cause, there's this dominant rising culture now that that's largely based in post modernism that denies reality to a certain extent, or it denies these truths, and it's kind of dishonest. And there's some cool things in that as well. But I it's almost like it's kind of like a course correction or rebalancing. And the problem with the app though, or even, or even like pitching the idea is that as as most people don't recognize the need for privacy until it's absolutely necessary. It kind of comes back to this tyranny of potential for tyranny. And like we see it like we'd like these ministries of truths that have come up with fact checking websites around COVID in the sense that now you have Reuters owning a Ministry of Truth. But the chair, one of the board, board members of Reuters is also a board member of Pfizer, right? So there's a conflict of interest there. And it creates this illusion that you're creating, like they're trying to just discern the truth, but actually, you're just giving control to an in a single entity who can then determines the truth, And so we want to break those illusions. 

Privacy matters because it allows your to escape. The ability for the dominant narratives to determine what you can and cannot think right like we've had using COVID as an example again, because it's just on top of mine, but like you've had Robert Malone who was deeply involved in the mRNA technologies. Pointing out the issues with these NRA virus, these vaccines right and that he silenced he was completely banned on social media, because he didn't fit the big tech narrative, right. And so like there's this media big tech kind of alliance that is trying to dominate the narratives over the internet entirely and support and censor or suppress everyone. And we want to be the inverse of that, but actually make it user owned. So we're not in control of it either. It's a public good that people can subscribe to. Anyway, that's not precise, but it is at least outlines the issues.

The real challenge there is to educate people on the issues of a nation state and then identify how this technology can actually help with that and position ourselves in creating a template or an alternative sociopolitical system. That is that addresses these issues with the nation state and say, “hey, look, you could actually live in this thing entirely if you want to and so it's kind of like a form of like emancipatory politics or prefigurative politics. And you can you know, you can just opt out and like use this technology.” And the envision is that you can pay, you should be able to pay for all your daily living expenses through it. And you can imagine, decentralized Uber alternatives, all these designed markets, because that's what the governance governance should really do according to the statement of the millennium, right? We should really only be designing better markets.

I think yeah, I mean, it's basically like traditional western values to a certain extent. It's like classical liberalism. Or, you know, just like around the enlightenment, partly just stuff, the post enlightenment sort of values and I think that makes a lot of sense. And politically, I think it's somewhere in there sort of center right. it's like the American project. It's just a digital version of American project.

I keep coming back to this independence in cyberspace. You can actually create an order that is self sovereign, but it has no no territory. It's very much like a second enlightenment. And I think that I think if I successful it is actually going to be that. It's going to be like this changing of the social fabric and it's going to be as large of a an awakening or change in the social order. Which is pretty crazy.

How are existing ‘converts’ going to continually experience more and more people experiencing the brand and its quality? ie watching them convert

More people in the app, more communities in the app, more transactions and accounts being created on the network. They're gonna see marketplaces pop up. And people interacting on them. They're gonna see the crypto diaspora move to like a location. They're gonna see special economic zones set up that are crypto native or crypto friendly. They're gonna see other proto states or autonomous regions adopt our template and create their own national currencies. Like the Catalan independence movement, for example. They gonna see like roles in informal economies or shadow economies be formalized and start adopting technology and then of these developing countries getting access to global markets, they're going to see countries that have unstable institutions like Argentina adopt our stable institutions and populatarity of the DAO and the amount of people working within the DAOs grow as well.

We want narratives, right? So maybe there's a pop up economy that we create or film documentaries of events or help facilitate 

*How do we express a precise and authentic point of view?*

We remain true to ourselves and true to our collective beliefs. We preserve our ideals and persuit of truth and the discourse around it

We break through illusions of truth

Privacy matters, we enable society to escape the ability of the dominate narratives telling us what we can and cannot think

We address the issues of the nation state’s prefiguratuive politics and how our technologies can help create a new template

Creating decentralized markets

Classical independence in cyber space, self soverign order with no territories, See it as a 2nd Enlightenment

What does it mean that a brand is well known familiar and respected?

The end goal is to kind of seek international recognition of the network state as well which is really far out. But how it will be observed, we hope to be in the top 50 or top 25 of crypto projects by marketcap. So, for for people who buy into the project wouldn't mean that they're making money or they're earning from it. It would mean that there are people in the world where they live entirely within the system, they don't use fear, they don't need to use institutions or will have deed registries and stuff like that. So property like buildings and real estate will be registered on chain for example, There will be a court systems so they'll be actual cases that have been adjudicated through through through this system. It's basically a lifestyle. It's this crypto lifestyle.

We (you) as builders and our tools should maintain a consistency to scale. Imbalances will offset and compromise our collective ideology.

Free software / Free culture 

decentralized alteratives to all centralized services

DAO matchmaking

It’s very much like Brave New World right where people are. Prisoners have their own impulses and distractions. And I think we want to provide a counterbalance to that, for example, trying to incentivize fitness for example and well being and that sort of thing. There's this whole mixed reality thing, that's also another way we're contrasting. That's kind of like we're anti Facebook. So I have a Linux VR project, Linux XR, and so we're kind of creating the operating system on how mixed reality should be. And it's something that you own and control and can adapt and change, right the same way you can with Linux. 

So there's that whole free software and free culture movement behind them. You'll be able to walking in a park and have your desktop with you. But you'll also be able to block all of the ads or you wouldn't even see the ads that are being piped to through Facebook's Meta.

On the ground you'll start seeing money exchange kiosks, like, particularly in developing countries. They'll be offering Logos, they'll be exchanging Logos. Instead of people using Uber and like, there'll be a decentralized alternative that they can own, so it's like riders themselves, like delivery people or drivers will actually own a part of the network. And the network will be apart of a DAO and matchmaking. So you can imagine a self driving car, but it owns itself, and so it earns money to basically pay off it pay its own maintenance. And so it becomes like this automated system that kind of owns itself, but then it actually gets orders from this DAO. This is sort of like a utopic vision of technology where we have these systems that that are that are not controlled by middlemen, right like this is disintermediation that's happening

I want to talk about parallel nation state open common law, 3D printed guns, eventually because that's going to be necessary. ways you can compete with a nation state problems of identity and social credit scoring. But on this side, there's these major branches - ideology and philosophy branch, human resources. certain properties that we want. I've already mentioned hyakkimaru liberties, you know, sovereignty. Virtue ethics, I think is important like we want to provide like a way of life or lifestyle, that kind of the gods human universals and then provides competing governing services. 

We want to talk about how freedom can actually be slavery and then we can talk about, the ills in the world. Anyway, Institutions that we can provide, we want to provide a constitution we want to provide a media arm that has alternatives to like social media and that sort of thing. But those won't necessarily be created by us. We want other people in the community to build them. 

What social tensions are we arising out of?

```jsx
Class warefare

Unbankable economies

Oppression

Stateism

Captialism 

Priveledge vs Poverty

Imperialism

Legacy laws vs digital laws
```

What collective desires are we fulfilling?

```jsx
The right to chose

Making a visible difference here and now

Advancement for equality 

Protection of privacy

Transparency

Democracy
```

What collective anxieties are we satisfying?

Emotional benefits we're creating ideally, it's like a peace of mind. You're able to opt out of these systems that you might not actually like, and there's an alternative now where before there was none there isn't.

 And I think that's why a lot of people are in crypto is because like, holy shit, like once it kind of clicks. I can actually own these things and nobody else can take that away from me, or I can transact with anyone and no one can stop me transacting with them. The theorem can be criticized because it's entirely public, right? Anyone could know my balance my bank account balance and under our system that will be private. If you want it to be it doesn't have to be, but it  it can be. 

How do we stimulate the desire of closeness, how do people feel stress being separated from us?

They go back into a world which they know is sending them false stories and false narratives. They go back into a world where their money can be taken away from any any moment.
They go into a world ruled by coercion. They go back into the world of normies and NPCs.

That makes me stressed just thinking about it. I think how we stimulating desire to dedicate time, energy and money to us, I think that's really important, right? we want to make sure that it feels like a community that you can participate in and you can actually influence any aspect of the trajectory of the technology and what it does in the real world. So we could have missions where we want to go to a place and we want to understand how they work and then try and codify their rules and onboard them into things. You can imagine going to Nigeria or Kenya where they actually love crypto, or even in Brazil or Argentina and then you can have we have stories people being on boarded into into the application and onto the network itself. Ideally, every like the entire organization is a DAO. So you could run the organization on a node. And you could vote in influence, So it's the ability to participate in the co-creation of the network towards the common purpose and a common goal.

I think is that stimuli that would stimulate me right. But I don't know if that's just anything else. Okay. Mystery. Your account balance, I guess, right. Yeah. Your communications right. So like your metadata but is there another way to put that like? Yeah, I mean, yeah, like, I mean, with privacy, we're not you know, we're not revealing your metadata. We're not revealing your account balance. We're not revealing your transactions.

What are we deliberately not revealing?

Your account balance, Your communications. Privacy, Metadata, Transactions...
We're not revealing the communities that you decide to join. We're not revealing your identity unless you want to. So it's about the right to selectively reveal yourself. 

It's more that we're deliberately revealing just out of a human side, right. Like, we're just we're just people. We're not trying to be elitist. What was great about the early internet is you didn't know who you were talking to. And you didn't know their gender. You didn't know their race, you know, you didn't know any of these things. And so it was purely about the domain of ideas. And then ideas get judged on their own merit.

What legends are we building?

What great stories do we have in the past, present and future that are capable of becoming inspirations for people?

Yeah, well I mean the ambitious legend is literally the next iteration of the American project. The network state is going to be one of the first network States if not the first network state that's ever going to exist, where we're showing how crypto can make a better world that's going to transform everyone. 

I think the great stories we have in the past, present and future we should really try and glob on to hearing the Cypherpunk stories amd the likes thereof. And we can we can reference the previous crypto war that United States has in fact, we're we're actually going to be going into a second crypto war, it's already happening, fear in UN Global regulation, and then we're going to be the antithesis to that. That's the present and in the future. We have an entire society that is using this technology and operating this way. I think people will feel inspired by that. 

How do we stimulate the senses? 

It comes through memes or the culture or the internet culture that comes around it right.I think of that sort of the ‘despair wojack’ to ‘sunset wojack’ thing it feels inspiring, it feels hopeful. It feels like there's another choice and there's another way in the world. Like another path that you can take if you want to.

How do we generate empathy?

Yeah, I struggled with this question. One thing that used to happen a lot in the crypto community we also did it within Status is this ‘hugging culture’ it was a free hug movement. And it'd be nice to just hug people right? It's nice to get a hug. It's a little weird, but once you just get over yourself. It's nice.

Yeah, I like that. You know? I think there's you don't get hugs from other people, right, not strangers and stuff like that. And it makes you feel more connected as well.
I feel like there's a lot of stimulation through visual imagery which is going to come out through the visual language that you that you develop.

How do we generate commitment?

If someone buys into the token, it's a vote of belief in we've created, And then if it goes up in value, then it creates a stronger sort of sticking incentive. But I asked myself this question, “How does Ethereum generate commitment?” Why did I become committed to Ethereum? And I felt like it's because I could create anything in this system. Very early on, Ethereum a just a cooperation like I've decided to build a permissionless and trustless mobile department of Ethereum. For me, It was almost like a quasi religious experience that like I found my people, I found like-minded people. And this was something that was being built in the open by everyone.

You can facilitate that with like meetups and stuff like that. I started the meetup in Amsterdam, the first first meetup we had 70 People just rocked up and it was just 70 people that all thought the same as me. And I was like, Oh, my God, this is amazing. And then the next meetup we had, it was over 90 people and we overflowed our venue. It just kept growing.

There are people who buy into these things for like a very selfish reason, I was trying to explain this to my friend who’s interest is based on trading. What you're doing is very selfish, what is the function of your trading? How are you contributing to the community of of people who are trying to create value, and the best answer he can come up with is liquidity. But it's not really that, he's doing it for selfish reasons, He's trying to extract value. And there's actually a whole other side of people who are trying to create these systems for a better world. And that's how he can extract value is because these people are energies that do that, because they believe in in this vision of how things could be.

Play the game, But it's also good, right? You can view it negatively, but it's good because they're still interacting. It's a different way of interacting.

How do we generate empathy?

Ensuring social liberties is not only helping ourselves, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the rights of others.

For example, KYC and AML. There's millions of people that are locked out of the financial systems because they have no identity or they don't have the documents to even fulfill the KYC AML obligations in developing countries. The problem is is I always view this in the negative, and I wish I could shake that and switch to a more positive mindset.

Transparency, it's permissionless network and it has a high degree of confidence in what happens on it. If you create a transaction and is committed to the network, that's not going to change. 

Case studies / docu-series for the network could be interesting, but at the same time, I noticed that many of the rights activists, they don't really get a following. I've noticed Access Now is trying to generate empathy or like any of these charities, they try to generate empathy for specific people or stories and that works to a certain extent. I don't know if that's the most impactful way to go. about it.

I think we're going to experience adversity. There's going to be pushback on what we create. And I think the people who are sympathetic to what we're trying to do will feel empathy as a consequence of of seeing that adversity again. If we manage to build a community around this, in the same way as a Ethereum and Bitcoin, It's going to be personal because they've committed to this already by buying a token. Once attacking starts, things that attack crypto in general is going to generate empathy and create more polarization for people. 

Who are committed

I think Signal did a really good job when they created the advertising campaign through Instagram and showed people how though being targeted. There's gonna be data leaks, for example, and there's going to be companies that get hacked. So there's going to be websites that go down. And every time that happens, that's something we can bring to light.

On a positive note;  we can have stories where we're showing how people who aren't being serviced by their institutions. Whatever their daily life is and how that can be improved by moving into this technology.

You could imagine entrepreneurs and developing countries that are struggling and then all of a sudden they can have financial assistance, grants, micro loans, payday loans or something similiar to assist building up their businesses. 

Actually Occupy Wall Street is a big one, it comes down to emancipatory politics. The 99% was upset about how the world was structured, and particularly the financial world. And this is another alternative to that. Because it's a community, it's a discourse, we're going to experience things, Ethereum has the DAO hack in its past. Those sorts of those things are gonna happen almost naturally. We live through them.

What is our parallel world?

People powered software, It's kind of like this uprising that comes from this grassroots perspective. It's fairly libertarian, I guess. But the social tensions arising out of is kind of like the tensions that we're feeling right now, both the occupy movement and like the subsequent divide and conquer strategy that governments are employing against their own people and a sort of forcefulness in misinformation through dominanceof ‘big tech’ slash government and media narratives that people know are false. It's the erosion of civil liberties we failed and it's kind of like pushing back on that.

It is more demanding because it is real freedom. we have personal accountability. You do have responsibility. But we also try to make that as easy as possible to manage.  We also want to encourage self improvement, meditation and fitness as well. 

You're not deferring or or even victimizing yourself. It's much more collaborative. I think a social tension that a lot of people feel is a consequence of like post modernism and Cultural Marxism that's rising, right. I think that's bigger than people realize. And people don't recognize the roots of that. Mass movements got replaced by identity politics, before identity politics, people had mass movements, which is the power of the people and this is very much like a resurgence of that.

 I think this is like one directional communication with media that you mentioned is kind of important. What I found so great about Reddit and Twitter, for example in the early days, it was proper social media, you could have these conversations and these comments and you could talk about topics and that sort of thing. But it changed, They started censoring a whole bunch of stuff. I got banned for up voting. 4chan is pretty hardcore place, I do still visit these places, that's the kind of dilemma for me is I don't exist in Reddit or 4Chan. I have like the same feeling with Bitcoin and Ethereum , I have kind of like a foot in both worlds. 4chan eventally got worse, partly because all of those opinions and/or negative opinions are censored on Reddit and on Twitter, and so they end up just like you just get this concentration of people that are more abrasive. And ideally, you want to have people have communities that they can go into that have different flavors, but they also aren't being censored. Or being monitored.

In 2016 4Chan, was a very different place than what it is today. And I've been thinking about that a lot, Twitter has become very politically polarized, I find that really bizarre and unfortunate. When I think of big tech, what we're creating is more like ‘community tech’ or ‘local tech’. 

You just create another topic or another community that has a different set of values or principles within it, but like it doesn't stop the other one from existing. You have a lot more right to self determination. And that's also important for the network state, you want to be able to give communities their own right to self determine themselves. Instead of having ‘big daddy’ that oversees everything for you - you can have moderation and censorship, but that's local to the actual community that you're subscribed to. And if you don't like it, you can create a new one. And bring people over if you wanted to.

What collective anxieties are we satisfying?

freedom in general,

freedom of self expression or right to self determination. 

The ability to opt out of existing systems. 

Independent you know, it's like independent media. 

And getting an another perspective or another opinion
The right to choice, The right to transact you know,

a strong sense of private property rights.
The pursuit of truth
transparency
a sense of community

```jsx
Oppression, surveillance, privacy, inequality, technocracy, tribalism
```

How are we building a protective barrier?

it's the technology stack, If you're in that - you're in a different world, you're in a different system.

It has privacy from the network level to the transactions you make to the communications you do. The whole thing is largely protective in the technologies allows you to have this sense of self sovereignty that you wouldn't have otherwise, the whole network is a protective barrier.

Well, maybe that's also through decentralization. Right so by making all making all of us accountable none of us become accountable right. 

what's the difference between Bitcoin, Ethereum and then logos? What would you say? 

See first paragraph

*How will we prevent being irrelevant?*

Doing the exact same thing that Ethereum has done right, and not make compromises with technology, and just now it can't uphold the original ideals. 

How do we express a precise and authentic point of view?

Neocypherpunks

We would have an authentic point of view that would probably be shaped by it's actually what just makes our brand voice unique, right? So in a way of us taking all of these ideas, looking at them all together, we would definitely have a point of view of how we see the world that only most of us within the group agree upon, and then how we act that out or what comes out of it would be our authentic point of view, it would be our unique view on how things are it's like, what does Neo cipherpunk movement look like? Like that would give us an audible language. So I'm thinking that, that that's how it would just be this belief system that we're creating would give us this unique point of view that we all you know, kind of rallying around

I think this question though about expressing precise and authentic points of views, it goes into all of those, but overall, just actually just asking us to, you know, have certain sets of values or collective beliefs, right? That's only the thing that will give us an authentic point of view that's different than anybody else, like what makes McDonald's different than Burger King or whatever like that. That will be the thing that we have that we collectively rally upon probably by the end of all of these questions when we consolidate everything that will be the collective point of view that that makes us then have a different voice than Aetherium or Bitcoin or somebody else. I like the Enlightenment thing.

Only that you can make it like a some type of digital enlightenment there's some other type of it's like a second enlightenment right.

How are existing converts going to continually experience more and more people experiencing the brand and its quality watching them convert?

it's like a Bible you just have a narrative that that people can just put themselves in right any any of the stories, comic books, any of those types of vehicles or work if Spider Man replaced Jesus, everybody would be believing in Spider Man.

 I think also with the consistency of all the values and everything going forward, that consistent voice and consistent messaging also helps maintain large and larger scales right, it makes it easy for people to be believers because it's consistent messaging also, it's not scattered and
I think that's part of the thing we just said is that  it has been there for some time. 

It's weathered through something and it also probably has consistent values messaging, it's probably relatable to people, it's proven itself to be able to stand more than a trend right? It's something there it's more it can evolve with society in a way that keeps it relevant which I think is one of the biggest testaments for brands is how well their understanding of the narrative with society and the playing with it right like if a lot of those brands didn't conform or use recyclable things or whatever follow these narratives like they get they would get pushed out.

On the on the surface is two parts, right? You definitely would have a digital twin of the real world. There's some balance between nature and technology so there's the combining of those two elements and how they work together. I don't know what exactly that balance looks like but I would imagine the more more we destroy the earth and nature the more incentivized people will get into technology the less reason they'll have to go outside due to the lack of entertainment.

How we see our world: 

I think once the technology gets good enough you'll be able to act in probably interact more seamlessly in nature with the technology like for example people now that are staring at phones in the park but if you don't have to right you can still enjoy the park in still use technology there's a better probably a better marriage between the two than there is at the moment 

We see decentralized services alternative to all centralized services that would be our ideal state

Creating shared connections:

We are creating connections on a deeper levelwith people share the same ideas we do. As long as you're honest and we have this unique point of view People can also share in that. 

Using real world examples to focus on the product benefits essentially, you know, it's more about the outcome and the positive outcome and the benefits that can be for whatever the group, whatever group and then that's things similar to what you said being able to participate for this common goal in the network.

Yeah, and it's also things to rally around for people. It's promotional benefits as well, if it's about real freedoms, they don't question anything about money.  if it's about your freedom, it's not really an issue then about the cost of it. 

Or if people will sacrifice anything for freedom there, you cannot put a price on it. 

So I think that is an important emotional dialogue, you invoke a spirit out of humanity to protect other humans are doing good 

what what are we deliberately not revealing? 

This is interesting. Exactly whatever we want.

We're regular people, there is a disorganization to our organization. There's always a front we feel we need to preserve that keeps a brand consistency, but we are just people interacting together in a more civilized and calm manor unlike big corporations which treat people like machines.

I had written in here before that it's not as important who we are or where it has come from but why so it's not about us being a certain way or where we're coming from but the reason why we're all doing something together

Maybe we're not deliberately revealing our own identities or our own points of view fully in a way that people can be less subjective. 

Maybe it's more just like Satoshi who wasn’t deliberately wasn't revealed 

what legends are we building?

yeah it also is like with the memetic thing it also shows you this pulse of culture that is very open that you can also empathize with that that's important right why those it's so nice right why so many people connect to it is because it's a truth it's a cultural truth that yeah that I think that's exactly will touch all different senses right whatever emotions or whatever yeah yeah I also didn't answer I don't know I had something about something else written here that wasn't about senses

one but I think the mimetic thing is much much better it's like we're looking right at directly at culture and we're commenting on it and we're being truthful

yeah, it's just the natural human connection
Mm hmm. Yeah, the other way to connect

intimacy, how do we generate commitment?

I think people are become more and more committed when they see the effects of change. When you talk and act consistently, it shows in our actions and product benefits, there's a power of change that comes from a group of people discovering things together and the difference that they make. People we want to be apart of that.

You somehow find your people, a relatable group that really feels like you can change society but this has changed over time which first began in town halls and communities and now we find ourselves alone with technology and media and every everything is just thrown at us. It is very difficult to block this out of our lives.

But it's not a dialogue in a community dialogue anymore. So it's very rare to also have a group of people that are standing by together that want to do something. I'm upset about this, what should we do about it, where most of the time into getting pissed off at a TV or radio that's a one way direct form of communication, you can't do anything about it. 

There's a group of people that are really hell bent on changing something that's a real problem in the world. That feels really good. So I think that it's dangerous in an in a good way. Because people aren't aware that that's happening. They're not aware that there's a movement of people out there that want to use their talents for good to change the world in a positive way. I think that everybody feels like they're fucked. And this is hopeless. And there is nobody like these small activist groups making a difference. 

But when you are inside a community such as ours with such talent and motiviation you realize the narratives in the media and outside our community are wrong. Dead wrong. So what else are they dead wrong about? Our scene is asking itself and society hard questions about how to write the wrong doings currently happening. This is what mainstream media should be helping us do is rally people together rather than break us apart.

What is our parallel world? 

It would be more about being able to have more of a collective humanity or self together, removing of individualism and work together. So this would be something we're enabling, that would be the vision of our parallel world is that it will maybe be a bit harder for people because you will have to ask yourself harder questions. But you would, if you were interested, you would be able to have some real freedom, maybe some people would love that, but there will be the possibility to have a real freedom that nobody's ever felt before, right? Which is a lot of responsibility but it would then at least be an option, whereas at the moment, it kind of isn't.

People have been alienated on purpose, there's also the television the way that news is delivered, like all of these vehicles that isolate people and create  class warfare, the messaging seems very focused on this individualism or tribalism that actually is counterproductive to anything that we're meant to do collectively 

When you break people down in individuals they cant do as much. They lose sight of the people as a power.

That seems more like how our community feature would be right it's something more world exactly because we just be this filter which it seems like the more options there are then everything can become much more specialized in a way right like things that aren't is I don't know the same as Twitter can go on to Reddit and everything else just falls through the cracks and goes right to Fortune which is just horror and pornography and hate and so it's hard to sift through but when there wasn't as many options it's somehow regulated itself a bit better right or it could it could somehow which now it doesn't it's just I'd imagined it you'd have it also it would begin to happen in our communities as well if there's all communities within the communities right yeah yeah yep should we answer a few more because it's getting late for you and not imagine this is quite draining

what collective desires are we fulfulling?

The right to choose

Transparency

collective anxieties are we satisfying

 

oppression

surveillance 

privacy 

Freedom / Liberty

technocracy 

tribalism

How can I contribute to this going further? 

The people who contribute and will actually work on it, don't do it for the money in the first place, which is the community that I want to cultivate. It's because there are all of  OG people that believed in this original vision of Ethereum that has not materialized and they are jaded. 

It would be great if we can provide the space where we are working on that stuff quite seriously. 

 I was also thinking about your question, you know, like, how do you kind of avoid some of these right wingers and stuff like that? And I, I don't think the answer is that you should, but you can. Like, that's also a component of panculturalism that I liked is that it wasn't nationalistic. 

And so as soon as you do that, or you turn off a lot of people and if you talk if you start talking about a lot of them, like rage against Vitalik for mentioning artificial wombs because they don't believe in that kind of technology, and they see that as as a threat to their way of life. 

And so, there are certain stances, you can take on some certain things that will alienate them to a certain extent. But at the end of the day, privacy technologies have the ability to safeguard freedom of thought or freedom of expression, is always going to attract whatever faction in society is being actually oppressed. 

 And it's not the people who are being oppressed are not the ones that get all the money from George Soros or any of these other people who fund these these movements, There is a group of elites that will literally fund these movements for deliberately dividing the people. 

The global elite, who recognize that now the population is turning against them. And so they started interjecting race, among other catalysts to divide the masses. And then that's kind of where BLM old spawns from as well. It's, it's engineered, it's not like those groups havent’t always exists, BLM has existed before it got funding, right? It just gets amplified by money. And then it gets televised by media, because it's the same owners, you know, like, and we all just go Oh, shit. And it's just like, you can see, like, if you read some of those materials, and you listen to some of the other side, like, it's harsh, like, it's harsh, because they're angry, of course. But, you know, if you pass through it, and you take the time to research these things, like they pointing out the funding sources of this stuff that they're trying to understand the situation they're that they're in, and not all of its true, and not all of its accurate. And you have to do your own independent research to understand what is true, and you know, what is more emotionally driven. But you get a much clearer picture of reality.

What do you think about people that will also say, well, it doesn't matter because it brings awareness, and it brings change, right? 

Like, that's also, you know, it's like how you have unisex now and other brands, they change the language, everything becomes equal, everybody becomes more sensitive, everyone is having their agenda out there, and everyone has to be more understanding of everyone and their feelings. 

The roots are in Cultural Marxism. 1So basically, my understanding of what happened is, once you know, once Hitler became a thing, and you know, people started flooding from that, let's say, let's say communists, they actually reestablished so there was a thing called the Frankfurt School in Germany. And this was developed Cultural Marxism. And this is a recognition that they couldn't achieve communism, through economic means alone or using the working class. And so they actually started looking at developing the ideas on doing focusing on what they called the Social superstructure. Right. And then what they did is when they all moved to America, they then relocated the Frankfurt School to continue that work. And then they did a lot what's called a long march of communism, into the institutions. And you'll see that now, like they actually went into all of these middle areas of institutions, but particularly in the universities and that sort of thing. And it's, at the same time, that's when they started radicalizing all of these identity groups and changing, changing what used to be mass movements that weren't racially bound. 

Occupy Wall Street is an example of a mass movement. It doesn't care. It didn't matter what genitals you had or what skin color you had. It was it was a class struggle, right? Yeah. Um, but identity politics have got flamed up and radicalized. And as a consequence of that, at the same time, you have a consequence, but at the same time, you also had universities creating safe spaces. And so the dynamics of universities have changed entirely. 

When now all of a sudden, you're having book burning happening in universities, you're having books being censored by universities, you're having safe spaces created. You go. But before that time, you went to universities to debate ideas and challenge ideas and be exposed to more more of reality. Yeah. And so there's a, there's another book that's called the coddling of American Mind, which is exactly about some of this stuff, where it's like, we started creating things more to be more safe. But in doing that, you're actually creating a form of like, self censorship. Again, it's like it's another establishment of a panopticon, or another way of like, having communists ideas of like, having citizens turn on other citizens if they're not conforming to the dominant order, let's say, yeah. And so. And it's deliberately constructed in a way where it's like, oh, actually, it's deliberately constructed in a way where it's like, Oh, it sounds good, right? And it feels good. 

But what is the consequences of that means that you can't actually speak your mind anymore, or you can't actually have a debate anymore. And you can always look at what you can't criticize. Like, it's, it becomes very clear what you can't criticize, because like, you know, if you say that, Oh, actually, you know, feminism isn't actually about equality anymore. It's about power, then you'll labeled a misogynist. Right? And then like all of the people who now label as misogynist, like, of course, you don't want to be a misogynist, right? Of course, you don't want to be a racist, but you can't even have an a dialogue to question it. And that's the that's the thing, right, like, and now you're getting like, you know, these kids that are growing up in this environment where they're walking on eggshells constantly.

You can argue that maybe that's, that's good, I am going to guarantee you that it won't end up good. But there's a lot of research you have to do and like and reading you have to do to understand the political climate and where it goes, you know?

well, you don't know the reason, we don't know.

But I have a feeling that when too much focus, like you say comes on the wealthy, they just throw a bunch of money down into the pit, and then all the all of the common folks start rumbling and fighting amongst each other. It just throws little fires in there, and then we're messing with ourselves rather than focusing on Yes,

it makes you they reinforce the decoherence of your mind.

But it looks genuine. And that's all theirs means that it masks itself. You can't say it's not because it is for a cause. Right, and then choose something or say let's focus on racism, or war on drugs or LGBTQ. I mean, so here's the other thing, right is like the minority like to there's two things that I mentioned. Ayn Rand has a great quote saying “The smallest minority there is the individual.” 

It's like anything else is actually a group of people. But the narrative sign to fall apart now even more, because if you look at the strategy against domestic violent extremists, that the US is now creating. They label every minority, all of the different gender groups that say, and women, right, so what you're left with is actually just white males. That's the only people who can possibly be domestic violent extremists. And then you're like Well, what's that about? You know, like, it's, it's most I guess, I don't like the term white, because, you know, I've mentioned to you before, they actually can be brought down into nationalities. But there is also another group who claims their whites when they want to force an agenda on white Americans. 

But then they switch to their other nationality, when they want to be conceived, seen as a victim, or pool, the race flag or whatever, right? And it's just like, you have to, you know, if you spent any time scrutinizing it, you get a little bit, you know, you, you hit the wall of your reality, or the wall or you're, you know, you're up against the glass of your fishbowl. And to make the extra step further. You, Brett, you literally break out of the matrix that say, and that's kind of why a lot of the, you know, like these right wingers, or 4chan people, you know, like, they say, you know, you take the red pill, and there's this whole red pill culture there. So, I mean, the red pill is culture is also related to, you know, dating in general. And that's quite a fascinating thing, because like, I had a lot of friends in the pickup artistry scene with pickup ops were, were a big thing, right? And really fascinating development in that narrative, because pickup artists were largely guys who felt insecure about their ability to get women or were rejected or whatever. So they actually learned how to get laid, essentially, right, and how to manipulate women to get laid. And they'll just try to figure out a system right, but then like, then it became like, how do you like maintain frame is what they call it? And how do you kind of, you know, like, make sure that you're kind of like the seen as the alpha male or whatever, because it because they're incentivized to do so. Right? Because like, if you if you become this beta guy, or you be your genuine self, then the girls lose interest in you, right. And so like the emulating, being alpha and stuff like that, but if you look at say, like, mystery, who was very popular back in the day, and you see him now, he's like a shadow shell of his former self, who's like, got these, these kids that he can't afford to pay for anymore. And like, he's, he's been, you know, he's, he's no longer married, he's divorced, and these sort of things. And he's just on this couch, there's a video of them make an interview with him on this couch. And he's just like, Oh, man. And then like, there's another guy who was what was his name, he wrote this book, it became quite popular. But then this whole dating scene started realizing, actually women not worth the squeeze, because they had worked so hard to like, build themselves up and actually become these like, quote, unquote, alpha males, then now they're realizing that these women don't have any value to them. And so they all sort of going into this sort of MiG tau thing, whether just men going their own way. Yeah, anyway, but it's a completely different narrative, right? But like, it's super fascinating to watch that development. Because I mean, I kind of live through it.

But it also depends on what you're after. Right? Because certain thing that's like a certain image, so if you find that whole, like, you know, if it's all about a physical attraction to you, and you embody that, so you need to work out to be this guy that appears to be this fucking jock. You will, of course, attract Airheads that have the same value superficial values that you have and it's gonna fucking probably implode unless you maintain that maintains that. So in the end, you get what you will,

you'll get what you want. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

Downfall of you as well. Because if you're smart, you don't really care you rather have maybe a slightly you know, more of a knowledge base or you know, an intellectual relationship or something else, which that you don't need you already know to be yourself and you'll find somebody who would appreciate you for who you are, rather than than this image you need to make. Well.

Yes, I agree with that in principle, right? But then, like, this thing's like riffled slore. And then there's like the thing like these guys were understanding the nature of biology right and the nature of the human animal. And it is true that in, in, in a society where there is no inhibitions. Oh, you know, I was trying to say like last time, you know, like the institution of marriage, whatever the analog of that is or some kind of enforcement of monogamy. Monogamy doesn't come to like most humans. In fact, like, there is like a two year window where the relationship generally changes and then there's a seven year what's called The Seven Year Itch where and they have groundings in biology both around children and childbearing right. It's super fascinating to read about like this, this whole evolutional biology perspective they can take on it, but um, but yeah, like, I mean, what I was trying to get at is like, taking the red pill was understanding just like how the humans work, so to speak, in this environment. And I

Unknown Speaker  30:59
You also need to realize that like 80% of men on studly like you, right, like they, like they don't have those looks that you have, right. And so and so like, you know, yeah, sure, you can. You might be able to, I mean, there's another book that you'd be really interested. I don't know if you'd be interested in that. But there's a book book called, coming apart, the state of white America by Charles Murray, right. And he shows how it's a fascinating read, man. But he shows how certain government policies, particularly around welfare, created created a massive increase in like single mothers, I think that's one example. It's in the book, right? And because as the state becomes larger, and starts taking on more responsibilities in terms of welfare, then like, people start using it as an animal analog to like, a paternal figure in their life. It's kind of like a big daddy write quite literally. And it just fosters a completely different social dynamic. And he's, he's the entire book, he's saying, you know, it's about a white America. But at the very end, he says, this is actually more impactful in every other minority. And white America is one of the last because it's one of the richest and most stable in in America. And because it's shown, because it's shown in white, and he just shows like every other class, and it's just even worse, you know, and it's just like, Oh, my God, he also wrote the book on IQ, and how it relates to different ethnicities, which he got massively. Exactly, yeah, he got massively under flack for it, right. But he's not trying to be. And you know, and so he's labeled as racist, of course, but he wasn't trying to be racist, necessarily. He was saying, like, you need to undo like, this is reality, like, this is just how it is. And we need to work with that. And just deny it and pretend it doesn't exist. Yeah, you're never gonna be able to solve anything, or create something that is fair, because you're denying these things. And you're just going to be wondering, you're just gonna be like, Oh, I don't understand why this is the case. It's, you know, these are very controversial topics, and I feel uncomfortable, I'm recording all of this, like, yeah. Believe me, like, there's this whole other world. And you can go much deeper into it if you know, but it's, it's not really relevant to what we're trying to do. But but there is a certain level of motivation that understanding these sides of other perspectives, let's say I don't want to say I like other realities, but these other perspectives give you a much better understanding of, of reality as a whole, and you'll never know the truth no one ever knows the absolute truth. But going back to what we're doing, and like, say logos and discourse is that you're enabling these different sides to be able to talk like to not only talk, but then you want to you also want to cultivate the ability in yourself to listen. And that's kind of why I also linked that Marilyn Manson thing he's like, you know, at the very end there, he's like, you know, I wouldn't have said a thing because I would have just listened because that's not what anyone else did. And it is so true. Like, you know, you have these these kids What you see in the media is predominantly white. It isn't actually always the case. But that's what gets the attention. And people just wonder why. Right? Like they they label them immediately as like psychopaths and stuff like that. But they just troubled teens that are not getting, like they, they have like, they don't, they know something is wrong. And they don't know what's wrong. And they, everywhere they turn, they're getting rejected in some way. And so of course, that distorts a mental, your mind. But in the brave new world revisited as well. I'm rereading that today. And last night, but um,

Unknown Speaker  35:42
he also mentions that, you know, like, in cities like mental illnesses are increasing. And this is, you know, he's writing his writing this in the 60s or something like that, right. And it's only getting worse because it's it just is isolating, and it's not treating, you're like you're in a community or in your village or you're in personal in a system of organization that is trying to achieve these economic goals of progress. You're in a company or in a corporation. That is very much against the nature of humans, in general. So yeah, there was an article that came out in 2000, at the beginning of the vaccine rollouts, basically saying we should release a drug that makes people more compliant. So they'll take these vaccines for the greater good, right? And that's the way that people think, right? Like, if you start thinking that the social cause is more important than the individual, then you justify all the means towards that. And it's absolutely tyrannical and authoritarian. Yeah, it's, it's kind of crazy.

Unknown Speaker  36:56
But it could be seen a little bit like a product of what happens, um, from all these stressors, and things that are placed, like overwhelmingly that just begin to neutralize people and they have to take Zoloft and these things and just completely nullify them in some way.

Unknown Speaker  37:15
Yes. Well, it's like, you know, I took some antidepressants a couple years back and I think people like the amount of alcohol and drug use went up as a consequence of lockdowns because people are trying to cope, right.

Unknown Speaker  37:31
Yeah, we have the coffee shops here open. They stay open here. Oh, yeah. First thing that was the very actually the first problem with the society here when the lockdown happened was the date first close to coffee shops. And then they reopened the mall because they realized, like, you need to keep the liquor stores open like you had to. Yeah, um, you see the lines, they're always huge. They're big. They have huge lines around these these places. Yeah, I hate for obvious in London, because every roundabout you had like the offI, you had the gambling, betting holes, and then you had the liquor stores next to it, it was all there just like a trio that are always together. And they always found themselves in the most, like, punish impoverished neighborhoods as well, right? Even in America. Like it's positioned perfectly to just ruin these ruin these people.

Unknown Speaker  38:33
Yeah, they don't have a chance, right? It's kind of like, it's really weird, right? Like, it's like, there's a market demand for it. So it comes up. And it's like, it's a way of finding relief, but it's also the thing that enslaved you and traps you even more. It's like a carnivorous plant yet or something.

Unknown Speaker  38:54
They're all traps. Same with sugar. We had some issues here in Holland, where they're looking to really inflate the tax on junk food and shit. So people can't afford it. Right, like, the same as how they raised for cigarettes or whatever. But I think it's obvious would hurt society the most Nobody chooses to do anything about it, because it makes lots of money. So yeah,

Unknown Speaker  39:19
well, you know, I don't know. I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  39:25
make out alcohol just like, you know, but it's

Unknown Speaker  39:30
not treating the fundamental problem, right? Like, like this, those mice Utopia experiments, right where, you know, like, or even when they start giving mice like cocaine and stuff like that. But then they take him out, they take him out of his shitty environment and put him in an environment that's actually really nice, but still leave the cocaine there. And they stopped using it. Right? And it's like, the use of like, you know, cigarettes and alcohol, drugs or whatever is symptoms. medic have their poverty or their circumstances, right. And it's like, if you can't solve the fundamental problems, then just taxing that thing is, is only going to create more psychosis or it's going to create other more harmful ways of dealing with this situation, you know? I don't know. It's very complicated, but it's, um, it's it's yeah, I I can't say that. It's it's a sound policy, even though

Unknown Speaker  40:36
it seems

Unknown Speaker  40:37
it seems like Yeah, yeah. It's kind of like, it's kind of like, you know, policies that enforce a minimum wage, right? Yeah. And actually, what you end up doing is you change the prices on everything, ultimately. And then you find a new equilibrium with a minimum wage is no longer enough. It's like, universal basic income. If you incentivize people not to work, they're not going to work. You know, it's like, we already know this sort of stuff. And we've had different experiments on UBI is that show that this is the case? And then you get, like, people who really believe in UBI like, no, no, no, no, that wasn't a real one. That's not a real one. It's basically the same as like, Oh, that wasn't real communism. Well, that wasn't real socialism, you know? And it's like, guys, you know, I get I get that you have a heart and you feel for these people and you feel like this is a good solution. But you're not paying attention to what other potential second door dairy owner effects of this these these policies

Unknown Speaker  41:44
are? They are they are or they are aware of it. And that's what they want.

Unknown Speaker  41:48
Well, there's there is that as well, there is that as well. I mean, and I don't know if you've seen like, his it was his name was a URI Bisman over whatever. He was a KGB defector. And he was talking about, like, useful idiots and stuff like that. And he was talking about how this thing will roll out in America. And he was saying this ages ago, man, and like, if you're watching it now, like I watched it when I was in my late teens, early 20s. But if you watch it now, it's almost prophetic. Right? Like, I'll find it for you if you're if you're interested. But yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  42:24
mille right. There it is. You can you can opt in for that, for sure.

Unknown Speaker  42:28
Yeah. Anyway, so. But there, yeah, I mean, there's just like, there's a, there's a larger conversation going on. And then you're just having people unable to talk to each other because they are using the heuristics. They don't have time to do that. So it's easier just to kind of go, what is the headline? Say, Okay, the headline says that these, these people are bad, I'm just going to believe that that's bad. And it fits into my framework of how everything else is bad. And I'm not gonna understand I'm not gonna, I think that I understand what they're about when I don't know anything about it, huh? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  43:12
I also think that it's like, similar to the matrix, and there wasn't the population of people that were aware. It's very, it's considerably smaller than the people that have just Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  43:24
And they live in shit, as well. Like they, you know, they live in the real world, and it fucking sucks. There's robots that are trying to kill you all the time, you know.

Unknown Speaker  43:33
But I feel like that's the reality of like, those of us that are just aware, it's like, it's a really problem. People, and I don't think it's ever going to change a lot that much, maybe a bit at times, but I don't think so. By majority will always be people that choose, I think, to just not acknowledge it, because it takes self awareness or self actualization. And people aren't aware of that shit. They are not aware. They're, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  44:02
they don't want to Yeah, they don't want to think, right. They just want to live their lives and be happy, you know, and that's just being in the matrix. And if you start going down these rabbit holes, then you will leave the matrix. And the robots will come after you. Yeah. And you will be living in a in a very crappy underground world, you know, and that's literally what happens.

Unknown Speaker  44:28
I mean, yeah, I think it will happen for those of us that choose it because you want the truth.

Unknown Speaker  44:35
But I don't think Yeah, exactly. Like, I mean, you have to be you have to if you want liberty, you have to be vigilant all the time. And in fact, if you want democracy, you have to be vigilant as well. And most people aren't. But it's also because of the meat like again, it goes back to like television and like the medium like it. And brave new world like

Unknown Speaker  44:55
you can think about homeless people in this way that like they just didn't opt in For stuff, like there were some people that just didn't choose to participate in society the right way. And they get completely casted into this. Like, it's not even true. It's like, imagine if we just didn't choose to make certain decisions. We just wouldn't invite it in. Right? But it's, it feels like that's a bit weird. It's like, with this matrix as well. It's like, you meet some of these people and talk to them. They just made certain decisions. They never had a smartphone, or they choose to live on a boat, or whatever. And they just excluded from society.

Unknown Speaker  45:32
Yeah. Well, I was homeless, right. I was homeless for a while. And I hung out with homeless people, because we got, you know, like, that's what you do when you're homeless. And there's actually a millionaire. In Perth, Western Australia. He has a million he showed me his bank account. But he's actually homeless, right? Like, it just he doesn't. He just rejected all of that. I know, there's a guy, another guy, he, he, uh, he's girlfriend left him. He got fired. And then he came back to his house and like, he was like, I just want to pay rent anymore. And so he just walked out. And he just, he just went to the streets. And that's it. You know?

Unknown Speaker  46:14
There's a book, I don't know that I tell you about it called the Mole People that ever tell you about that?

Unknown Speaker  46:20
Doesn't ring a bell?

Unknown Speaker  46:21
No. Basically, I think it's Hemingway's niece. And she was at NYU, she wrote her thesis paper on going under ground in New York around I think the 90s, like late 80s to 90s. And there's community of over 300,000 people living underneath New York City. Very structured communities. There's what's that? Jennifer? Tough? Yeah, that's her. And there's also a documentary you can watch on it where the guy actually I think it's Mark singer actually goes under there and films it, it's called, you'll see it if you type in more people or more people documentary should also watch that it's super interesting. She does this for a year where she goes into these communities and meets these people, they have really organized in terms of like, all different walks of life. And the deeper you go, generally it gets more dark, like more people that don't want to be found. But she comes across like this group of people, there's models, lawyers, all kinds of people that were just like, just didn't accept society. And we're like, fucking like you said, they just went underground. And they just chose to live in a different way, because they were tired of society. So it reminds me also this matrix idea, like I could foresee that us if we chose not to opt in fully utility systems could end up like that. Right? So like on the fringe fringe movement.

Unknown Speaker  47:44
Yeah. Well, it's, yeah, I mean, blockchain technology, and crypto was literally a bunch of guys. Like, I mean, I was there, like, we're old fringe society, kind of Outcast kind of guys, right? Initially, when we fit in a single room, you know, and it was just all it was all kind of weirdos and like, we're all just like, hey, this is like a really cool technology we could like, and then like, we're imagining the future like what could happen? I I don't think so. I think in our case, were providing a system that allows that protects your value protects your wealth and money, right? And there's people that understand this and believe in it. It's the dominant narrative of Bitcoin, right is like you can move out, you know, you can move your money out of this into the, into this system. And then like, there are a whole bunch of people in finance that are in personal and amoral, they don't care as long as they can stash their money everywhere. And there's a whole bunch of people that would like number accounts in Switzerland, but they can't get any more because KYC and AML, largely because of America pushing it. And so if you can create a digital Switzerland, that's where the money is going to go. Yep. So I don't think and then like, you know, you can, with a special economic zone, you can pay a mayor or whatever, to say, hey, look, we want to buy or rent this land. We're gonna live here. And you know, we'll give you revenue like, well, you know, that's your interest. We understand that you want tax revenue and that sort of thing. We'll give you that as long as we can live in under this system, and we can administer this region ourselves. Right. And so it's kind of like mold people, but you're living on on a beach or something like that. Yeah, that sounds better. Yeah. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  49:50
I just generally worry about the how fast people with motivated people with bad ideas can move Right. Governments and things how quickly they can just pass pass things. And then you know, like action and it's the same with the COVID. Shit. Like, look how quickly these assholes can mobilize a bunch of bad ideas in, press it on everybody. Right? If they feel threatened the same they will with all of this crypto, the crypto, they will try the exact same thing it already doing it. Yeah, but I mean it with force, let's say. And then us building we have less capabilities less. You know, we were building slower because we don't have this mass majority of evil and resources like all these other fuckers do so in some way, I feel that that's gonna be it will be a thing probably we'll come up with. It's going to happen to us, right? Yes,

Unknown Speaker  50:48
you're Yes. It's gonna happen. Yeah. But you can dip?

Unknown Speaker  50:54
Of course. Yeah, of course. It's no problem. Yeah, that's why we exercise and lift weights and can build things.

Unknown Speaker  51:03
Yeah. Yeah, I'm very aware of that. Right. Like, and it's partially one of the reasons why I don't I made the decision to do this before status, right. And I was like, okay, these technologies, in my opinion, in my heart, I feel need to exist. And I think that it will actually lead to a better world. And for me, it doesn't matter status is not successful, it matters that the idea was proven. Like, there was a prototype that showed this could happen. And there's a level of martyrdom that's in my life, right about this. And I, I don't engage in relationships that you know, and partly because I don't want that to be used against me or her anyone else, because of my actions. And it's not like I'm trying to do anything, I'm not trying to make anything evil, I'm trying to make things better. But I, you know, in the state of the third millennium book, you know, hands on the second reigning Prince of Liechtenstein, even says that oligarchies are going to go off the year, if this becomes a thing, right? Because you're now competing with them, you're creating something that's better than what they can provide. And if people realize that, then there's a problem, but I think it's worth doing. And it's not like, you know, what else am I gonna do with my life? So I'm actually kind of primed for it, you know, like, I don't have like very strong family connections. I'm fairly independent thinker. I can do it, I can do it. And I'll push it as far as I can. Yeah. And it's not like, like, like I said, like, if the UN sees utility in what we're doing, then like, Absolutely, like, let's like, the network state is literally like another way that you can construct a new world order. So but it's actually more peaceful. And it's not as top it's not top down. In principle, so it, you know, the ideal vision is that, like, we create this like, kind of virtual one, it's kind of like a toy, but we've proved the concept. But at the same time, like I speak, I spoken to people in Kuching, like the general of cotton, right, of the cotton independence army, they love this idea, because they can create their own national currency, in a place where it doesn't get bombed in a place where they're constantly being attacked from all fronts, you know, and but they're, they're fighting for their independence that was given to them. When the British moved out, you know, like that they have a treaty with the UN saying that they, they, they are an independent nation, right. And, and because they suffer what's called the natural resource curse. And China pays Myanma to, and 40% of their GDP goes from that the mind muscles, the military, and then to extract the the natural resources, and they don't have the resources to extract it themselves. Right. But this is a way that you could potentially help them escape the natural resource curse, while everyone wins if you can create a national currency and give a circulation, a partial portion of that to the Chinese, and to the Burmese. Yeah. And you do the trades of natural resource extraction in that currency, you encode more value into that. And if that currency is also circulated amongst all of the people who consider themselves Kuchins, that will increase in value and know everyone become more prosperous, and that whole industry will become legitimized, right. Like that's the power of what you can do with this sort of stuff. In 3d. Yeah, there's a whole bunch of socio political issues, right, and like, you know, but it's the current state of affairs. wouldn't change right and and there is this other. This is counter shadow government called the National Unity unity government, which is comprised of all the people in my mind who were for liberation and actually pro Kachin. And they're ostracized from the military coup there, right. And so if they do manage to regain power, there is this ability in the future, maybe 10 years, 20, who knows when, but there is, there is a glimmer of hope, or there is a light at the end of the tunnel. And it doesn't mean that it's going to happen. But if you don't prove, if you don't provide any mechanism, or any tooling to enable it to happen, it will never happen. Right? That's the difference, you know. And, and the same with like, the Rojava ones, right? Like, I'm Mia Taki, will fall in the frontlines of their, and they were trying to establish democracy in the caliphate of ISIS.

Unknown Speaker  55:58
And, of course, they're getting bombed by the Turkish, they have terrorists on the other side, and like, you know, they're trying to create equal lights for women in a democracy. And, you know, they're struggling, you know, like, they, they also benefit from this technology, because allows you to have the stable institutions, not in a building that gets bombed right? In Nigeria, right, like, there's real property deed registries, but you have to go to an IRB, I think it is like, and for one guy that I spoke with, it's, it's like, a seven day travel to get there, right, and then go back. And what happened was they, they, he went there, he bought the land. He went there to register with the registry, and then found out it was already owned. But like, imagine if you could just do that, like, imagine if it was like a registry was in a system where you could access it. Without that space constraint, you know, you would, you would instantly understand that this is a fraud, or you could buy from the real person. And that's, like, that's the difference again, like it's, the idea is so measurably powerful, and it just solves so many transactional cost issues in the abstract sense. It reduces these transaction costs so significantly, that I can't not do it. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't care, I don't care what happens, like if it doesn't, it doesn't matter. It's worth it, it's a life worth living. And the other side of that is like, the way Ethereum is gone. It is like the perfect tool for surveillance and capture. And it's the worst kind of capture, because now you can economically exclude people based on like a social credit scoring system or something. And if it if it doesn't get done in the right way, like if it gets done in the right way, it means immeasurable liberty to anyone who participates in it. And if it gets done in the wrong way, it gets it's a totalitarian nightmare for the next generation of dictators. And that next generation already exists which is what you're kind of worried and fearful of. Like, the whole idea of a two party system does not make sense if you have a group strategy, which owns both parties, which is exactly what happens in United States but nobody is aware of that. Hmm yeah. Sorry, I went on a bit of a rant there but no no i don't know i It's it's it's really important to me

Unknown Speaker  58:44
I can see that so some questions I just didn't Yeah, we should do that. To find out to figure out which document and where we are Oh,

Unknown Speaker  59:00
I think we

Unknown Speaker  59:02
think we are at

Unknown Speaker  59:08
we're talking about emotional benefits because the rule like what like what I was confused about the header or directive benefits in the auto direct the benefits and then there was the social benefits after that right?

Unknown Speaker  59:19
We did. Also what are we deliberately not revealing? What legends are we building? What great stories do we have in the past present and future? Wait how we stimulate the senses we did right? How do we generate commitment?

Unknown Speaker  59:38
Yes, we got to we got to the what social benefit people benefits to people get how do we help them to self actualize? How do they why do they feel part of the community? What are the common attitudes, opinions and self in and interests? That's where I remember we got up to last. We did Turn 68

Unknown Speaker  1:00:09
How do we help people escape daily reality?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:14
I think we did this stuff ages ago to me we got past customs. Um We're definitely at the benefits area. I'm pretty sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:31
Yeah. What about do we do? How are we helping people self actualize?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:41
Yeah, we have, that's where we're up to. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:49
So how do you think we're helping people self actualize? By giving them all this type of information? Yeah, I mean, or the possibility to be aware of it. So yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:01
I think like, going back to the brand name, like logos, like we're helping people understand, like other sides of the discourse in the pursuit of truth, right. That's one, one way, if we're talking about swole, then we're helping people become fitter and better through proof of workout. So we can help, you know, like, doing virtue ethics and stuff like that like. But then like, we're also giving them the ability to have access to global financial markets and stable institutions. And that's important in developing countries or in like Latin America, for example, because they don't have these stable institutions and like this. That's the reason why that whole black market of Bitcoin exists in Argentina and Brazil.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:54
It's also a two part thing, because if you try to encourage people to think as individuals more to trust themselves,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:08
self reliance,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:10
self reliance, but also at the same time, you want people to have also a group mentality where they're able to think more than just about themselves, but be part of this greater good in a way as well. Right? Like, yeah. Because it seems like a lot of what we're taught now is really to are reinforced now is to just, it's only about us and ourselves, as opposed to we don't have this awareness anymore of the pack, or our neighbor or something in the connection isn't the same as it used to be probably when we

Unknown Speaker  1:02:44
before. Yeah, absolutely. Like, like communities through status, right. Like you're finding like minded people, but then like, with a brand, like we want to help people understand that they can help people, right, yes, like, ideally, we're helping them go to these places and understand how they operate. And then codify it and this kind of gets into this whole. What's called, like, this other side of it, which is, like informal economies, there's this to this, there's a book called The Mystery of capital by Hernando Desoto. And there's another book called Shadow cities, right? And in that they're talking about, like, these illegal neighborhoods, or favelas, or squatters and stuff like that. There's many different places all over the world where they have like these other these rules.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:42
Sorry, counter economies and

Unknown Speaker  1:03:44
things like yeah, it's it's like the shadow economy is where they are trading entirely in cash. Because they are excluded, or they're excluded from the white economy, let's say because it there's too much regulation. Or they just, they have different ways of doing things like different rules or whatever. And so in many ways, you can help formalize these rules for them. And still people with same properties that they have in their current system. And still keep it private. But now like they have reputation systems and stuff like that, right, like Will they have like other alternate forms of insurance like this is like those, I forget which African country it is, but like there's these women that pull their money together. So like, if they one of the dole breaks or something goes down, like they can all help each other. Yeah, get back to where they were awesome like that. So it's kind of like a community insurance system. It's not dissimilar to Dutch brewed funds, actually. Yeah. For unions. Yeah. Or unions Exactly. Like they're just different forms of that. Yeah, like the shadow cities book is a good read. I mean, they're both good reads, but the shadow book is a good read. Kinda like opened my eyes to like, how other people live and why they live that way. Mm

hmm. Yeah, everything got a little bit complicated. It's almost like if everything. Like we said yesterday, everyone's just striving to have the simplest form of like, communes in simple societies, aren't they? It's like, we're trying really hard to do kind of emulate a very simple way of life. But it seems super complicated. And it also seems now that with all of the way that we've been, had all of these things pushed on us, it's almost like anybody that tries to have any goodwill is already casted out by society in a bad way. It's like the first thing the conception would be if we start talking like this. Everybody will be super critical and have a go at us because of it. Right? It's not

like everybody. Yeah. Like I noticed, when you say everybody, you're talking about a actually a very specific thing. You're talking about people in the matrix, right? Or you're talking about? Yeah, there's power elite that controls media that does not like it, and so will then use them tools to kind of push back on it. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, same, same with big tech, right? Like, if we create alternatives to Reddit and Twitter. And Uber, for example, actually like this, like right now, I'm pushing through, we're gonna do we're working with swarm city to create a marketplace SDK, right. And so you can cut out the middleman. And that's the problem with disintermediation, you're cutting out the platform owners from the platform, and now the platform becomes user owned. And so when you say everybody, it's not everybody, it's actually the people are gonna fucking love this shit. Because now like, like, imagine all the Uber drivers if they actually had a stake in the network, and they could earn money, just by holding stake in the network, right? Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:34
but you are going to drink Ubers milkshake? That's gonna be a problem. That's

Unknown Speaker  1:07:42
yeah, that's it. That's it, you know? It's not going to be it's not going to be me. No, but it's going to be someone who's going to be building on top of the platform that's going to be doing that. But we're all gonna be building on the platform, doing those alternatives. And like, we're growing a community of people that all support each other in the same way. It's a completely parallel system, and the people who come into it, like it's the little people that are gonna care, it's like independent media. It's like independent tech or local tech, you know, it's not small tech, but it's gonna become big.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:17
Yeah. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:22
So yeah, like, I mean, it's gonna be really interesting, actually. Because like, Uber had this problem going into all these different countries, because it's crony capitalism, and the taxi drivers were like, hey, you know, you're cutting into our margins like that. And now, like, all of a sudden, you can create a system where it's like, Hey, you're cutting into our, you know, our network idea that is our platform. But now it's not. I mean, there's a whole bunch of complicated intricacies of that like, like Netflix is unprofitable. For example, Uber isn't profitable, for example. Because they have to spend so much money just installing these networks, which I think is quite fascinating. So I'm very curious to see if you create a user own version of those things. How they get adopted or not, you know?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:16
Yeah, I feel like

Unknown Speaker  1:09:18
what had will happen

Unknown Speaker  1:09:19
generally is like, I don't want to say what always happens, it's like, you pioneer something, it's the same, it's like it starts and then it takes on this life of its own, with the majority of what has more resources and is somehow more evil. You know, it's like, I can imagine that we start to create these ideas, and then it just gets picked up by let's say, these smart cities or governments and then they just level the fuck out of this playing field that everybody thinks that it's intended as this small localized thing, but it gets wrapped up in something else. It's like what happened with Ethereum? Right

Unknown Speaker  1:09:59
That's it. That's it. exactly what happened to Ethereum? Exactly and people

Unknown Speaker  1:10:03
answer then the government's will just level eyes it everybody will think it's decentralized. And it has all these benefits. And they have no idea that they've just swallowed this huge mouthful of shit. And then it's like the same, I believe with the network statewide, but you'll have in the Amazon city, people think, Oh, this is a smart city now. And it is like we're controlling and running this thing. But it's completely not right. It's like, somehow there's this, you'll do the hard work of lifting and pushing, and then all of a sudden, they'll just be this. It comes in and kind of like,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:35
Yeah, but I mean, that's, yeah, I'm aware of that as well. And you're absolutely right. Like, I mean, there's that book called The master switch. Which is exactly that. It's about how you have these innovative ideas. You create these networks or whatever. But then as you rise up in power, then you have to hold hands with the existing incumbents, right? But I'm, that's part of the game, right? Like, if it gets to a point where like, if it gets to the point where, like, let's say, so there's two ways it can go, either you, you know, you kill me, but the idea is out there, or you Co Op me, and then I become part of the elite, right? It's kind of like an ascension into into that. And like, if that's what happens, that's what happens. And it's like, at some point, um, you know, at some point, that might happen, and I'm aware of it. And I don't know what choices I'll make in the future, right? But like, maybe like, maybe, like, if I go to share in an Amazon city, right, like, hey, they go, Hey, look, we're gonna take this technology, but we're gonna give you like, you know, 1% of yeah, I'll be like, alright, you know, well, I did what I wanted to do. Yeah, I mean, and I'll be old, then as well. Like, I'll, you know, I'll probably be going, you know, I did what I wanted to do, and, you know, hopefully, I can say that I did some good. But But I mean, like, you see it already, like I mean, like, that's why you see these central bank digital currencies, these CBDCs. Right, like, that's the answer to cryptocurrencies, because they're like, oh, shit, we want to have the cryptocurrency without the crypto, you know. And

Unknown Speaker  1:12:31
we'll have a network suite without that network state. Yeah, basically.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:34
Yeah, yeah. But I think that even in the worst outcome, you're going to be able to create, like, some, like in Amazon city, you're gonna be able to buy like, the tokens in the Amazon city, and you're gonna be able to prosper with that city while living in it. And yeah, and that's better than that's better than being in a city that you have no stake in whatsoever, and you're just being forced to do everything entirely. And just being a mindless automaton.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:08
Even though you might be working for Amazon as well, to pay for everything from Amazon.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:12
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, you know, unfortunately, that's the case. And then hopefully, hopefully, you can get a ticket on one of Elon Musk's rockets to some other planet.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:24
You send up enough credits, you can have an Amazon

Unknown Speaker  1:13:27
Prime trip. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it might be like,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:38
I just saw this other legal. This bill that was they're trying to pass where basically it outlaws it. What's it called

Unknown Speaker  1:13:47
Safe shop, shop safe. It's basically of all's

Unknown Speaker  1:13:54
anybody that creates their own types of products from selling them online. So

Unknown Speaker  1:14:00
got you saying that it makes perfect sense. It's perfect extension of the app store, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:06
Amazon has just like, implemented like some 3000 page bill that they're going to try to push through where it doesn't allow anybody as a maker to sell anything online. So essentially, you have to buy everything from Amazon or those subsidiaries. And that's it. So there'd be like, no Etsy, none of that shit, right. It's real,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:28
you know, that's another case for crypto, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:32
Yep, exactly the same with the copyright thing. Like if you buying a product, you should have the right to fix it or do what the fuck you want with it, as opposed to like, only using certain suppliers or whatever, right? Like it's control. It's bullshit. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:50
I mean, it reminds me of like those farmers who bought those combines and stuff like that and they no longer had access to it, or farmers who bought theirs Monsanto seeds and they have like to get into subscription license, you know, right to repair,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:04
you know, they get completely fucked.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:08
But they've hacked it the creditor and yeah. So I don't know. I'm a big believer in. I'm a big believer in inhumanity and I think there's still a lot of humanity left and a lot of people and I think as long as the tools are there, people will find a way, man, like, they'll always find a way and they'll do what's morally right, to a large extent. And it won't be everyone of course, like, but it'll be enough people.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:44
Hmm. Yeah, I think so too.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:50
I think it's worth really like, I mean, I think it's worth recognizing, like how these alternative pausable may come about, or, you know, you know, what is the opposition? But that doesn't, that only strengthens my resolve, right? Like, it only makes me want to do it more. Totally. Yeah. Yeah. Like, fuck that. Like, what? It's so empty. Well, you mean, like, like, You mean, like, in America? Like, you know, you can't even like, Wasn't there some bills or something of that trying to make like, or even making, like, your own produce? Like your own little farms and stuff like that illegal? Like you couldn't even sell your own milk or make your own milk. Right, that you know, like, and you're right, it's under, it's under this banner of safety. And it's not real estate. It's not safety. Like it's control?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:49
Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but I feel like that's a lot of the

Unknown Speaker  1:16:59
the hard parts that people there, they will definitely always agree to a point. But at some point, they lose it in their minds. Like, when you explain these ideas to people, they will say, Oh, yes. Like, the cause is good. That's a good idea. But then you always get into the same types of like conversations afterwards. That's like, how does that work? You know, or like, there, then there's no government, or people always get to the same types of points in the conversation, because people will agree on, you know, the, the good nature and the intention of those ideas, but they can't always proceed, because it's not here yet was the thing when you told people you'd be able to buy something with their phone, they tell you, you're crazy. It's not possible. But now we do it day to day, right. So it's, I feel that some of it. Yeah. There's, it's difficult when you have to pioneer these ways in because some people just can't envision the whole thing, right, like, visualizing it.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:05
What was who was you know, the mother of all demos? You heard of this? No, man, I love the name. So I think it was called the mother of all demos. So yeah, it was Mother roll demo. I'll find it for you. It's about computing, right? And it came out of the, the Xerox PARC movement, right? Like, before computing was even a thing, right? Like they had to invent the mindset or invent the screen with the goI and everything like that. They have to show that you could have a computer, right? Yeah. And I was gonna say Apple Hoffman. That's the LSD guy. No, Douglas Engelbart. Right. was frustrated because he was talking about these ideas, right, but nobody could grasp it. And the mother of all demos is when he actually created it. And it was completely hacked. It was going like they were terrified. It wouldn't work because the line between their super computer lab and the actual screen with a demo, it was like completely janky, right. Like the whole thing was like, Fox, but he demonstrated all of these systems. And up until that point, no, everyone was naysayers. They didn't understand any of it. But then when they saw it, it became real. Right? And that's the thing, right? There's a difference between, it's the same with what's the face, Genie, right? Like she's seeing things as they are like, not as they are, what they're seeing the face of things and not understanding the deeper abstractions that reside behind them. Yeah. It's worth watching that it's kind of slow you can find on YouTube fine boy, but it's just it's just amazing man. Like, it's history. Yeah. And it's like, it's fine for people to the people who say those questions and have those questions that people who will never do anything in their life really like, they don't, they don't think about it. They they take things as they are. And, and not they don't have a strong imagination. And they it's great that they're trying to engage with it, but they also don't have the faculties to be able to kind of, or even the it's like this, so caged in their mind, that they won't even make the attempt to try and imagine how it could work. And it's easier to just criticize it or just say, oh, like, you know, come up with these these ideas. It's like, yeah, we can answer them. Sure. But it's better to just ignore you, and just do it. And then you will see it and you like, Ah, of course. And then and then you'll think, oh, yeah, of course, I knew that sounds gonna work. I mean, my entire life has been pitching ideas to people not pitching but like, talking about ideas. And everyone around me saying, that won't work. Yeah, because I created the first bone tool for Macromedia, Flash invest and Max for 2d animation, right? Everyone told me it will not work. You cannot do that until I did it. And then all of a sudden, Macromedia like Adobe implemented in in the application directly, and I'm like, of course, I didn't see any money for that. That's fine. But it's just like, that's how it works, you know? Mmm. Hmm. Anyway. You don't need like, I mean, it's good to like, it's good to write these written articles about like how these things might work and have discussions about how these things will work with the people who want to make it. Yeah. Not with people who want to just criticize it or think that it's a bad idea with that preconception? Because they all never, you're fighting an uphill battle. And it's not actually a VAT. Like, it's not a valid discussion to get into because the premise is wrong. And it saps your energy.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:29
Yeah. But we need these people. I mean, ultimately, they'll come anyway, right? In some ways. So it's like, you don't want to give up on them. Totally, you know, because I feel like those are a lot of the good people that have good intentions, but it's just a little bit of a shallower pool. It's a little bit more low resolution. But I think

Unknown Speaker  1:22:55
those people are good for middle management. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, say, Ruslan, I probably should record this bit, but I mean, like the Russell and I probably should record this bit, but like, it's so it's sweet. But it's, yeah, ultimately, like, there's I don't care for them personally, like that kind of attitude. I can, I can use them. And I think they have utility. And I think it's great that they want to engage on it. But it's not the same as finding people who get it, and then working with them to actually create it. Because then it's like, it's a different, it's, oh, how does this work out of like, how can we make it work? And that's so much different?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:46
Yeah, it's more, it's definitely more of additives than the tractor

Unknown Speaker  1:23:51
in that way. It's my local community. Yeah. Yeah. And going back to the community thing, like, the reason why it's so complicated is because, you know, the telegraph the ability to send information over the wires, or through the air, it shrunk that space down to nothing, right. And so now everyone's having the same conversation in the same space because there is no space. And so what cryptography and the ability to create separation allows you to then create space between different communities with different people way people think. And of course, there's some crossover there. And like, if you want to discover these things and enter them, you can, but you don't have to,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:38
and also ruined a lot of creativity, right? It's the same in the visual like visual, the visual communities is that there is a difference back before all of these technologies and how people use their minds are creative. I mean, it's also the same with pornography, as well. Right? All the visual world, then feeds on a smaller pool of vision. and your individualism or these ideas, they also would become judged faster like, on if you painted or however you did anything visually, it is was a whole different way than it is now because there's a whole some information that's considered relevant or not right. Whereas before it was what it was, it was more it was. It was less visualized in some way right into the absolutely like,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:27
I mean, that reminds me of the VHS MasterCard documentary. Right where I sent you a link to that but it caught a VHS MasterCard, no VHS massacre. Massacre. There we go. Got it. Yeah. Massacre, massacre that works. American it'd be fine. Anyway, so, but documentary isn't that great. But the premise is, is that, you know, there are all of these independent cult films that could be funded, because the VHS retail shops where mom and pop shops, and they're all just ordering things, and they're ordering like different craziest stuff. And they didn't have the data of like, what made the most mass popular movies or anything that right. And then as like Blockbuster came through, and Hollywood got more organized. All of that kind of disappeared. And the same with toy shops. I remember growing up in there was like Mom and Pop toy shops. And each one had a whole different arrange of toys and stuff like that. Then Toys R Us came along. What them all out. It became a monoculture homogenous, and then like they never came back, you know? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:46
Luckily, we still have that here. It's it's still like a little community in that way that we have those like all owned toy shops in but you know, there is places to have McDonald's or something. But it's it's really frowned upon, in a way, right? Like, the only thing you have it with more as with supermarkets here, which aren't big, but you still have a sense of like one dominant thing, like they'll remind. Yeah, yeah, but other than that, it preserves a lot of this individuality where you don't get in America where it's just like one long strip mall from Yeah, it looks like the,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:27
what's it called the nine strat, so whatever, in Amsterdam. And I went, I went through that, and I was just like, I'm like, how are these shops able to survive? Like, who's buying this stuff? Because like, stuff for me, that's for sure. But there's some cool things.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:43
You have more, some brands are slowly moving in there, right, like, brands in there now. We're but the majority of it still is locally owned shops. And they've done a pretty good job in a lot of the streets to keep a lot of the local vibe there when merchants and things like they're, they're pretty honest with a lot of that shit. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:08
I mean, that's part of the culture though, right? Like it's the culture to kind of support that sort of stuff. And yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  1:28:16
find that it's a huge difference. The other thing I noticed here, like I was talking to Krista about, which I thought was really cool, was even in the education, like, of course, there's things that are a little bit could be debatable, but I like that they still have, like, for example, in this high school, they have these law programs in the high schools that have their own governments. So essentially, get into some shit. In the class, you will have an you have lawyers that are kids, and they have juries of peers and judges, they're taught like this very cool. You can go to a court and be represented by your peers and judged by your peers and have a judge that's all high school kids, which is kind of teach them these kinds of things. Like, this is fucking awesome. Like, there's programs like that, that exist that are like, I don't know, I think that's quite I love that.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:08
Yeah. There is a

Unknown Speaker  1:29:11
lot of me that feels there's hope with some of these kinds of things, like, you know, apart from the Prime Minister, but there are a lot of good forward thinking. Ideas that, you know, don't make me totally think that it's lost or lost. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:29
Yeah, I mean, like, you know, conversations. I get the sense that you I think you're very aware of the monoculture that put it that way, right. But then you're living in a city whether it doesn't have a dominant monoculture in the same way, right has it has a more independent eclectic vibe, and I think that a lot of those people like they don't engage with technology in the same way way that a lot of people do. And of course they do to a certain extent, like, I mean, everyone has Facebook except for me and you know, other people a little more hardcore, but, um, yeah, I don't know, I don't I think it'll always exist. And if you give the tools for people to, if you give tools to people to set up their small to medium business sized businesses like this, that one man shops or whatever, and they can make a living out of that, and they're able to kind of get out of the, the mind cage that public schooling puts you through. You go off and be an entrepreneur, and you see this in developing countries, like they're all entrepreneurs, because they all have to hustle. Like true life isn't easy for them. So you have more control of your life that way. Yeah, you're not suckling at the teat of a corporation or something. And and that's what this technology is about as well as like, you know, you like businesses foam around these marketplaces, right? Like you might like I remember in Airbnb, like, you know, those people that started renting out their own place but then they start renting out other places of other people or like buying houses to rent out or whatever and you know, that's that's that eventually you know, create something that becomes bigger. Sure. But it also gives the It also enables anyone to do it. Yeah. Monopolies always form eventually but

Unknown Speaker  1:31:40
yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:31:52
shall we? I'm just applying to cool. All right, shall we what?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:44
I'm trying to think where we should go now.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:49
Common attitudes, opinions and interests. Yeah, I mean, we can look at the EF f we can look at Zed cash.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:02
And we can probably extract a lot of that we can extract it from like cypherpunks and stuff like that. It's all the same thing. Really. You know, there's you know, the there's the financially emancipation, this privacy, then by financial emancipation, I mean, independence as well. There's the ability like disintermediation and decentralization. Like these are just terms, right? But like, what it means is you can become self sovereign, right? Like you can you can act without having to go through an intermediary. Essentially, it's, you know, disintermediation is really important because those intermediaries become gatekeepers, and they can say what you can and cannot do with your own money. And so, you know, it comes down to this self reliance or independence as well. It's freedom it's liberty. It's yeah. I think like these are the kind of the common these are common terms that that signposts to a common attitude I think the interests are like in technology and in a free and open Internet free culture.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:30
Philosophical ethical, yeah, yeah. Augustus Yeah. You know,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:38
free art, you know, free like Yeah. It is his counterculture to a large extent. I think that you know, a lot of people want to do good in the world as well, like they they want to make the world a better place.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:03
Yeah, it's very much. It's like an activist group in a way right? And yeah, it's, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:10
Well, like if you're decentralizing power it's more democratic right like you, you have to kind of get him you know, everyone on board to go in a new direction or something like this, right? It's like it's like a new form of democracy. I actually wrote a tweet today that I haven't tweeted yet. I'm not sure I'm gonna go there. But do it I don't know if I will. But like, go go go go go go go You're a bad influence on me when I put it right you

Unknown Speaker  1:36:00
got these builders outside my window playing heavy music? Oh, wow. beats per minute, just like going for it. At least not drilling

Unknown Speaker  1:36:13
as much at the moment. Have a. Nice

Unknown Speaker  1:36:29
night Nice. Yeah. feed that man. Bra, tweet a breath some of these are similar, like what socially relevant values will be based on? These a lot of the same? Answers, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:37:05
Yeah, I feel like I've been addressing the same stuff, I guess.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:15
Do we have a distinctive and this distinct in distinguishing manifesto? Jared, you've got the right to kneel Cypherpunk movement manifesto. I was thinking

Unknown Speaker  1:37:26
about doing a new Declaration of Independence in cyberspace, right. And then kind of having a similar format to Barlow's version of it. I was I was thinking about doing some stuff like that. I do need I do need to sit down and just and write it. But like,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:46
maybe after we shaped this thing, it will also reform itself into you know, something like that. I think it will, because it's just more as we get into, like, you know, really clarifying here old values, the philosophy, it almost writes itself in a way? I think so. Yeah. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:14
Are we recognized more in a consistent manner by things? So I think we are currently seen that way, fully what we are in a way that's not representational of us, I think, per se, but I think it will be much more clear. What What was the question? So are we recognize them on a consistent manner? Or in a consistent matter? Right. I think our I mean that.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:44
Yeah. I think so. I think there's a consistent through line here. Yeah, and especially with the visual language and stuff like that, and like when we start pumping it out there, I think it'll be pretty consistent. I'm not too worried about that.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:03
And how do we describe and express who we are? I think it comes through what we make and what we believe, right? I think that's how it's in the actions not the talking so much, right? It's more than the things we do become who we are like, what we build things like this, those reactions, it's not things we say as much. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:34
I mean, like we're, we're a self sovereign collective working towards a vision of creating a better world or this network state, you know, and then like, then describing what the properties of that are and why that you know, why that's beneficial. And that's who we are, you know, we're like these new cypherpunks we're taking the these ideas and we're, we're pushing them to then With the next level, you know?

Unknown Speaker  1:40:05
That's kind of also what we believe. Right? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:08
some of these questions get a little bit more repetitive, right? Like, the, the same questions, but under different brand models, essentially. Which tribe

Unknown Speaker  1:40:24
Do you think we belong to? I mean, I liked it. I liked the Neo Cypherpunk. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:29
I think I think that's pretty much it, right? I think like, but like, in contrast, like Bitcoin and Aetherium, like, it's very much more, it is more of a political statement, right? Like we're trying to, we're trying to inject politics, or this prefigurative politics, which is where it came from originally. But it's kind of gotten lost in the technology in the money. And so we kind of want to like, say, like, No, this is like, this is a, an alternate way to live, or like, we're building this infrastructure, so you can be more free. It's a new, it's a new form of democracy, right? And to me, it's like, the best. And I keep going back to that it's kind of like a new American project, right? It's like, okay, we're seeing Western civilization kind of crumble to a large extent, and we're recognizing our nation states that kind of taken over. By with, but you know, don't need to say that, but. And when we think we can create this system that's going to create more liberty for the individual and make it harder for authoritarian capture.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:48
Do you think then, like, I'm just asking, I'm just asking things that come into my mind. Sure. Do you think, like, on one hand, Wow, am I gonna try to say this or ask it? It's like, since we can do this, right, or since you can implement this in areas, let's say, have special economic zones, but it can also be implemented in third world countries where infrastructures aren't present. So it's much easier to help craft this, but I feel like the most difficult part, again, is coming back into when we tried to put it into the normalized part of societies, right. Like, let's say there are places that want to embrace new technology. But there still is a strong governing body there. That's like, it's

Unknown Speaker  1:42:44
Yeah, well, I mean, that's what Ethereum is for. Right, like, so that's the thing, right is like, Ethereum is adapting the technology to fit within the existing legislation. And yeah, yeah, inside those jurisdictions and within within the existing legal framework, right? Whereas we're saying no, no, no, no. Like, this is fundamentally a new kind of order. Like, it's not an order that's derived from monopoly on violence. It's an order that's derived by community consensus. And then from there, you can build your institutions on top of that. It's quite literally a parallel system to the nation state. It's a network state. And you can build these institutions on it on top of it. And that'll be demonstrated through like a court system that uses common law. And you can't argue with that, like,

Unknown Speaker  1:43:41
Huh. But can you imagine then, like certain cities would have, let's say, Ethereum, they'd be running on Aetherium or other places would run on something like logos or like

Unknown Speaker  1:44:00
no, no. So other community developed country, there is no use for blockchain in developed countries. Period, like, you have a stable financial system, you have a stable legal system, you have a stable social system. Everything works, right. That's not what this is about, right? This. This technology works in places where they don't have any of that. Right. And it's that simple, right? Like I don't think that there's going to be people who try and build things on top of Ethereum, like, you know, like, they'll try and create like a special zone that has, you know, things running on Ethereum, but it won't be it'll be running on layer two, which will be centralized. What we're saying is that The consensus algorithm itself and the nodes that support that should be owned by the local community. Right? So it's like, if you want to think about it in territorial terms, right, it's like a nation state. Or the people that are a nation state is kind of like a weird thing, because it's like, it's got this power structure, which is enforcing the territory, right? If you have a bunch of people who are running the nodes, that is a territory, it just exists in this sort of cyberspace thing. And if it bleeds into the real world, it's just the people in that are in the same place. Like the if you're building on top of Ethereum, it's kind of like you're living in America, but you're using tick tock, right? Oh, yeah, using Zoom, and it's actually an apparatus that's controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. And you might not be aware of it, but you actually have no autonomy in that. Whereas if you have this is something that you've, you're doing for yourself, and you have, you're still maintaining the sovereignty, the if you think about it in terms of a dowel, right? The doubt, like the nodes that you're running as what's creating the order for the Dow itself, like, you can't separate the community consensus from whatever you build on top of it for your people, because that's how you vote. And if you don't like it, then you fork away from it. So if you're building on Aetherium, and you had you were doing something in your own area, but you didn't agree with what something else that's happening on Aetherium you have to hard fork the Ethereum blockchain to create your own blockchain. Yeah. And so what we're doing is we're creating a system where you don't need to have that pressure, you can just spin it up yourself immediately. That's the network state. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:00
sorry. I keep asking you different versions. But I think that it's helpful that you keep explaining I'm not I'm not sure. It's helpful for me, but it's I think it's also helpful for reading and everything that iterated in different ways. Yeah, no. Okay. I don't mind like, No,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:20
I think like, it helps

Unknown Speaker  1:47:22
hammer it home. The more you talk it in different ways, I think it's, you know, and I'm also trying to ask questions that I think everybody will ask that is more, you know, more layman thing.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:36
No, I get what you're doing. And you don't have to apologize or explain or I thank you very much for asking these things. It's like, Yeah, I mean, like a Dallas on Ethereum doesn't have the same kind of sovereignty properties. It doesn't have autonomy over itself. It is bound to what Ethereum is doing, right. And this comes up, like, I mean, I saw some tweets, actually, the other day, I probably wouldn't find it again. But the saying that, you know, like most of these, you can already see the fragmentation. Like the reason like different layer TOS is spinning up is because companies want to have their transactions paid in the token in their own token, right? Or not companies, but I'm talking about Dows, or whatever you want to call it, right? There is a benefit into that. Because then like, if you buy into that community token, or you buy into that coin, and then those transaction fees are paid in that coin, you are then earning or you're creating value, and you're capturing that value, rather than bleeding that value into Ethereum. And it doesn't make any sense. Like why would you do that you're paying for a platform that you don't need to and you're not capturing your own costs. It's kind of like how s&t doesn't really have any value in, in the things that we create where it's like. Yeah, like, we can create our own network and we can have our own value and capture that value in our token for the transactions that we create, like it makes perfect sense from a technological standpoint, and from a political standpoint. But it's even more so when you start talking about it. And the political stuff. The political standpoint, because different like Bitcoin has its own ideology, and Ethereum has its own ideology and there's a reason there's a separation there and it's not purely because the technology is because these groups of people are thinking completely differently in what that technology means to them. Yeah, and like that's only going to become more like, isn't that there's going to be different ideologies like and different. Community shit like different To shed narratives in the community to reach a different kind of goal and it makes it just makes the most sense to me at least. Yeah, no, I don't know if I'm explaining it very well but you know,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:12
it's really it's really good I'm sure I'm looking through these to see if we can skip any of these to like, something more juicy got this music? You don't hear it right.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:42
I don't hear it. No. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:44
good now, there's things in here, because the next question is about background. It's like what is our credo fundamental beliefs and guiding principles, but I think we know that's, that's these values of philosophy. Yeah, whatever series of stories, but this is a little bit like these ongoing actions that we keep talking about what these movements that how are they capable of invalid involving its followers? Well, just see. Yeah, yeah. I mean, like,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:29
it's important because it's what we fucked up in status, right? Like, we ended up becoming this company that is delivering a product. And that came through our communication approach, right. Like we have investor reports, for example for fucksakes. Like, you don't see a thorium foundation having investor reports. They just building this technology, like they're building it for a nebulous purpose now, but

Unknown Speaker  1:52:00
We want to what I what is really important is that we create a community around like that wants to build that believes in this shared vision or this this purpose and like in these fundamental principles and values and then influencing everything so like they they can the initial We nerds that want to understand how the consensus algorithm works and finding flaws you know design and that Be in a forum where like where we have These it's kind of like a threesome I don't know if you go into that right but there's a bunch of like the Researchers go there and they do discuss how this thing is going to work and that sort of thing right So we'll have a For him that's doing that and For him that's disgusting like the The politics and the food Lhasa fees and stuff like that It's it's really about CO creating At this stage And we don't care about the end Investors we don't care about traders All right that that those aren't People who create value they really only that or extract value and What like if we can call that community and Create a sense of like ownership where it's not owned by Anyone and you you have You have the ability to influence any thing that you want in its creation And that's the most important One thing that we need to be able to communicate And for people to feel That's the case As soon as it feels like It's It's sad us that is making logo We've failed that Like Paramount It'll still work But then like we're in this VC coin arena This is something that You know that this is something that Carl doesn't fully on To stand So It's one of the hardest thing I think he understand and a bit more now but he's Certainly didn't understand that when we were Creating status And like status was Originally open source Client before we raise the money like Pete like we had a whole bunch of contributors They were just like this is fucking cool man like they submitting pull requests To do shit and then we go We got the money we changed our communications and because we had The money and it's like oh it kind creates this oh you're You got the money so you're just gonna go do that now and like you're now communicating that this is a product that you're delivering and It becomes this sort of like It's no longer a bi directional or multi site Conversation it becomes this one sided thing where you're Your company and like your faceless organized You don't know who is by and it's just sad belting out propaganda or marketing materials saying we You have now just done this we now released this you know blah blah blah blah but it's it When you were saying we it's not working community it's we the company yeah that's the fundamental part We need to get right Hey it's And so that gets spread through word of mouth right. People like Sacher and we'll know people and I know people Simona will know people and we can start bringing people in say, hey, like, we want to, we want to get back to these principles. We want to find the way we like, you know, do you want to join us in doing this, you know, and mate, like maybe they'll buy s&t on their own or maybe we'll give s&t out liberally to these people. Not because they've done anything that just because they believe or they're getting involved, you know. And from that, like, it'll transform into something like eventually it'll turn into something bigger than anyone. And of course, we've already got the money set aside so we can build it independently of any cooperation, but that's not how it was. That's not how it was when Bitcoin started, and it wasn't how it was when Ethereum started either. Uh huh yeah and that's what all these VC coins don't understand right and that's why they don't That's why Bitcoin in a third have the largest market caps because it genuinely doesn't feel like it's owned by anybody Yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:56:52
Yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:56:56
It's not so nice when you are Something new and then a bunch of the world comes in In fucks it up right that's it shitty thing it's like you found your way and then all of a sudden it gets fucked up because All these Muppets Come in everybody in the world come in It becomes this A huge dialogue and it's just ruins your Shit like

Unknown Speaker  1:57:19
that That's why I was so interested in like The creating a political party or a theology Your philosophical framework around because it's like it's a social thing problem you go no this is what we Believe in if you believe in trying define these ways if you believe In this instance Mediation and actually many sure that are uncompromising and all that sort of stuff I mean cuz that's what these people in you know 30 feel like there's the technical Now compromising that is no long What we thought it was going to be If we can tap into that With golden absolutely golden you know Yeah and that's elicit why we want to we want to move The move the reserve that we have into a dowel because Like this isn't our money anymore This is your money yeah you know and you You guys can vote to allocate that capital how Have you won But if you're joining this community These are the principles some values that we We all subscribe to and if eventually if we're good enough at hostile to anyone that Not necessarily like hostile directly but Like in conversations and stuff like that if we're discipline proving or shaming and kind of deviation away from that then eventually the Kim You will develop an immune system to that and it will go No this is what we're about and this Are we doing and if you're not doing that fuck off you No It's very much Like I mean silicon Ethereum There's two camps Unlike the The consensus kind of side of things got so big and People made these things sessions to kind of get daps tomorrow Get as fast as possible most of them have already You failed but they left this Tolerance for Creating a web two point In five not a web three And then like it go away with three got big that old People who are exposed to with three now like this is bullshit this is And what you're saying it is this is something else and like that's why you know Moxie wrote that thing and people are coming a little bit disillusioned by it Because like and now because they get disillusioned by it they then start redefining it to make themselves feel better and they're going No no no this is how it's supposed to work You know and all of a sudden As soon as that happens they forgotten and they They are incentivized to forget and make something That isn't supposed to Be

Unknown Speaker  2:00:03
well it's easy Isn't it for your own

Unknown Speaker  2:00:06
yeah yeah exactly it is Yeah no I yeah exactly It's a pat on the back

Unknown Speaker  2:00:15
Yeah It's a it's a rationalization right now Of course

Unknown Speaker  2:00:22
people They put all this time into these things They also don't want to admit You know that everything has gone pear shaped or They're just like and they're making money So it's okay right you Everybody has a point They will know You know begin to Yeah drink the cooler it'll

Unknown Speaker  2:00:45
happen right Because regulators catch up and they'll realize that These layer two are actually money transmitters yeah And then they will start requiring these layer twos to implement KYC and AML Stop censoring transactions Anyone who here for Not those right reasons are good Feel that cognitive dissonance And if you don't if you provide an alternative like another community for them to latch on to they're going to move to it

Unknown Speaker  2:01:20
But I think the same thing will happen in our community right we will then have A whole new set of issues to deal with The same as Bitcoin and if Ethereum vaccine you This yet but it won't come the same way absolutely and that'll be on narrative

Unknown Speaker  2:01:33
yeah

Unknown Speaker  2:01:34
exactly so it's just more like it's not it's just a journey It's not an end result or product Probably it'll just be part of a larger narrative yeah So

Unknown Speaker  2:01:45
like the second Meta narrative with the dominant narrative which is to say achieve this in an uncompromising way And you know how it unfolds is how it unfolds You know yeah but I think that if you can make the culture Strong enough in these certain ways at the beginning Get it to reinforce itself once it starts reinforcing it You're pretty good and as long as Is this like something like Ethereum was apolitical And so like they didn't define what it's going to be and therefore it becomes this negative Like it become it shifts to Whoever wants to define that you whereas if you can bitcoin is Like today they're strong as ever they just like no Fuck you This is about escaping inflation This is escaping financial Slavery and debt slavery that's what we're about Also some of us are Christian you know And if you don't like it Fuck off and then like That's why Then like a theory and people are like Know that toxic you know it's like No they just have something they're standing behind You know and they're uncompromising in it Yeah and if that hurts your precious Safe Space Hi Then so be it go play in your little fantasy world yeah while they play in this like we're all playing in our own fantasy world like Yeah

Unknown Speaker  2:03:21
Okay

Unknown Speaker  2:03:23
How do you feel about that because I noticed that it was a couple of fart browse in there and Like or thoughts or in which part I don't know like just as I've been speaking I noticed that you're you've been praying assessing it and maybe I'm saying something to you might not agree with or No

Unknown Speaker  2:03:45
I do agree with you I think that I think that When you feel strongly about something I think that which I think we have have a shared group of people that believe To some extent the same things right like my experience sins are not the same as yours or somebody else But overall we feel committed to a certain cause and idea and it makes things a lot simpler as As we see to put that out and immediately and get rid of anybody that isn't on board with it because otherwise it just always hurts us and it has been for a long time I feel like It's it needs to be also tried intested because it kind of Didn't it started almost a bit right we signed the principal these types of things but I think and also the love of the people on board originally We're pretty hardcore So I think now yeah

Unknown Speaker  2:04:48
I I fucked up in hiring Googlers and not having internal committee occasions that reinforced that during onboarding And so the the organ I became schizophrenic for a little while then we kind of like I didn't have the energy to kind of keep pushing that I didn't have the mechanism in place to kind of continue to reinforce that that's what Internal Communications matters just as Much as external community Now we have a good bunch Like most of the Google isn't gone like the Google have gone actually most people have Pretty good some people are Still naturalizing Let's put it that way no matter what we do But that's also a problem because we don't have If we're going to grow W organizations Sighs like we're gonna have that same issue again and later We get this stuff sorted now Which is why we're doing this But I mean we can draw from the EFF in the electric coin family I think the literate coin Like I said cash in general does a pretty good job You may never have like a website Whatever I know the guy I met the guy

Unknown Speaker  2:05:54
from Arrow I really that's cool when in London If he yeah he when he just did it like because I was also mining On the machines in my office like we I use my Whole company's servers to me Mine Oh yes we were that we had a talk with that guy was like we had a call with them because it's like dude you gotta lay Fix the branding and the app like all this shit he was into it Then I was like okay I'll do it from a narrow but then the agency was working with like no we're not doing that I was like rolling Amazing but this was a really long time ago but it would have been amazing TED When you would have given us millions of an arrow I was like We should totally do this

Unknown Speaker  2:06:37
They've done it yeah I mean

Unknown Speaker  2:06:40
Mr mineros site

Unknown Speaker  2:06:43
is to friendly for what it is I think I mean it's there's some good call You know in general like No this isn't like a copy here but it's kind of Like like this in capitulation here Like like For example in the Video on the front page You know like they have like the Happy Sunday illustration faces and I feel like that's a little bit I get why they're doing it right they're trying to make money errors seem something but it's not really selective of mineros community they like those communities kind of a little bit more special Given this you know sure you know For sure

Unknown Speaker  2:07:28
Yeah especially when you shop on the go Dark Web right more than their shoppers

Unknown Speaker  2:07:34
Yeah well that's it right like

Unknown Speaker  2:07:38
yeah But that's

Unknown Speaker  2:07:40
the other thing that I think could also do with a bit of Change is the people that perception is also people Hello again narrative that the media create It seems like there's a lot of positive shit like of course there's people buying drugs you can buy drugs anywhere but nobody talks about like you The Orphan cancer shot cures that you can portray for $30 that you can get off there there's people that need medication They can't get it because of insurance like theirs So many benefits to having an O open marketplace right Nobody thinks about it But yeah but they could probably all benefit from And in some ways right everybody wants or needs something It isn't readily available by the systems

Unknown Speaker  2:08:22
yeah that's it There are a lot of good

Unknown Speaker  2:08:24
narratives I think But yeah bitten or a mystic Good you know we could the benefits right There's a lot of positive benefits that also don't have to be recreated individually by smiley things that can also just be Like the gods on this

Unknown Speaker  2:08:41
yeah Well that's what I liked about films for action with Right like it's like yeah it's showing showing like you know how I interpret it is kinda like real world use cases to us next words Although you know they have a different

Unknown Speaker  2:09:04
They have a different bent

Unknown Speaker  2:09:06
about them but like There's something in the in the idea of What they're trying to do yeah like they have a whole section how the mainstream media Miss leads right

Unknown Speaker  2:09:20
I think that's kind of Oh

Unknown Speaker  2:09:21
yeah

Unknown Speaker  2:09:23
yeah Well I also really love that idea About that press thing with like all these different things If reels you put in real stories there you have podcasts like EF Bad does that it's really really nice right I think There's aspects to all of these brains that we really To that we can take parts of that really You can reform our own narrative that also gives us a a unique brand point of view yeah

Unknown Speaker  2:09:50
One thing that I haven't mentioned actually is You know this This guy called Bjorn Lumbergh right And I'll find it Ted Talks right because like It worth you watching it Alarm

Unknown Speaker  2:10:11
he also writes a book I think yeah He's written a couple

Unknown Speaker  2:10:15
of books right and like he he So I've got a book called prioritizing development and basically What he did is got like the top economist in the world And he said okay United Nations you've come up with these Sustainable Development Goals right you have way too many of them you don't have enough capital to all of them So let's go through the economist and understand Exactly How we can come Compare and contrast these things and understand exactly What how As the highest impact for the money so we can actually take that information like there's a whole I got the books on it right there you can take these things and you can say I remember For example in one of these things he's like Ciao Nutrition is more And then schooling If you want to have Having a more economically prosperous Life right like if you can fix their brain In the earliest stages of development and only cost like $97 Right you Do $97 That gives us The child the older nutrient they need for the first two years They're going to out compete People kids who don't have that but even have better schooling right and if you Turn it like they've proven it through studies Right like It's wild it's absolutely wild But he has these yeah I think like because he was trying Too My camera which one Where's he he's got a few talks They're kind of similar but they're all a little bit All right I am linking to them and I camera which one All right one But he was kind of chatting dies because he was saying that climate change isn't The best thing to do But like the elite One climate change because it allows them to choose other political agendas we don't need to get do that but yeah he's saying You know like you can spend all of his bills dollars on this You're going to have this next eligible impact over 100 is like in 100 years time You're going to change it by I like less than one degree if you did All of these things or you could take Without money and you can literally erase poverty yeah and so like That's what's so great about it batteries work because they they proved they prove this stuff thanks him

Unknown Speaker  2:12:48
more quantitative exactly

Unknown Speaker  2:12:51
and so it's kind of Like when I talk about the no state right and like how You can tie that to benefits in real world usages it would be great Right to kind of take these ideas and show like how we can make a Metal weld and like this is actually What we're working on this is what we want to make happen you It says you know For example in that book They have a whole discussion on illicit financial flows And that there was saying well illicit illicit financial flows can predominantly from corrupt politicians right And so and there's no studies on how impactful KYC AML is right at you we have no one idea of its efficacy but you want to impose that on everyone on the planet And so it's like actually You know you could Instead of doing that you could do these other things like reducing trade barriers And I think it was in the Copenhagen consensus I'll find it I made a reference to it in my interview Talk for the Copenhagen Consensus thanks Tank showed let like a point zero 1% Return reduction in transaction costs literally means the difference between Zimbabwe And Switzerland or something like that you know It was just insane like the the GDP our foot just by chance transaction costs right just by looking making things easier you know yeah and so you You can have these narratives that that kind of We can like yeah documents and kind of

Unknown Speaker  2:14:31
The truth the quantitative Truth yeah

Unknown Speaker  2:14:35
I think that's also very important from a branding perspective It's like yeah we're creating this The like We're kinda like cypherpunks but we're understanding the United Nations problems and then we're showing how this Technology taps into these problems and The awesome counter to It's more rational right like and more quantitative as you said like It's like we can do this Things like we can actually implement these things So it is a bit more serious It's like actually showing these things and it's not totally punk

Unknown Speaker  2:15:10
It's Punk in a responsible way yeah yeah

Unknown Speaker  2:15:13
yeah it's Exactly right like it it's not cute see there it's just like this As an adult thing yeah

Unknown Speaker  2:15:20
Thankfully it's like when hackers grow up this is what you can do Right yeah breaking while you're fixing things actually that have been broken as opposed to breaking things that seem To be working Yeah

Unknown Speaker  2:15:34
Yeah have you Read your next government yet It's wonderful I was I was shilling these two books I think I have the notes for it somewhere right I'll put it on

Unknown Speaker  2:18:04
I think that we have a A lot of content here what I what I will do next is I'll take each of these questions back Hello I'll just delete A lot of a lot of dishes it's never been a lot of the the hours Make it more simple I'll simplify those points and then I'm going to send it back to you and I'll also Have a look and see if we got everything which I feel we have and there's also a lot of nice stuff in there that we can elaborate on further or take for the further ideas but I think from this What I would what I would try to do is look at this and then Look at if I can extrapolate value values or principles reform those principles out of it Like so you don't have to think about it as much or at least I can put In front of you and then we can have another discussion about the edited These are what we can come out of this right and then maybe hopefully that helps inform or give you some ideas for these manifestos are Whatever and the other thing that I would do with This after we get into that state is then I would check I would like that to take that and share it with this whoever is going to be this strategy intent person or this activist community person like and then We have a document to work from that we can each think about What does these things mean for each of us right yeah and then They can elaborate on these things in terms of language and terms of the strategy like you know like acting stuff yeah that's me my plan with stuff and then also it could be nice if we get it in such a place you know this can be the departure point for like with the podcast stuff with Corey or I don't know something You publish it can be online published which I think would be nice We internally we can use it like there's a lot of valuable things because you're getting You know this is the insights that I think that we need to Fundamentally yeah
