**Brand / Comms**

I find metaphysics / perennial philosophy a really important pillar for our branding and communications - like speaking to these meta narratives of human soul (specific to a culture) kinda like Jungian collective unconscious. Especially Spengler's concept of the Faustian man (Western Culture) and its 'infinite' symbol - which also ties into Frontier concept in War and Peace and War (which is what network state or parallel societies are about)

A drive for knowledge and self mastery. Faustian man, Spengler boasted, discovers his own potentialities in confronting an unbounded universe of unlimited possibilities. He strives to see all things in relation to the highest or most distant horizons, which, in turn, he seeks to surpass and extend. The souls of Faustian men (and they were all men) make them visionaries, creators, and discoverers. In their souls, Spengler told them, they are pioneers, builders, and conquerors of time, space, and human subjectivity. Faustian men are always preternaturally more: more creative, more daring, more individualistic, more heroic, more ambitious, more restless, more demanding, more lethal, more self-denying.

This ties into Hoppian positive freedom of libertarianism, freedom for excellence, greatness - rather than negative freedom aka 'freedom from' (all constraints) as in liberalism
