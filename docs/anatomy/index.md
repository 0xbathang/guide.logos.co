The Logos Design Language Guidelines are structured to provide a modular and adaptable system that can be customized to suit different branding needs. The guidelines are divided into three main sections:

- Philosophy
- Voice
- Visual Language & Design Systems

Each section is comprised of individual components that can be mixed and matched as needed to create a cohesive and consistent brand experience.

## Modularity

At the heart of the Logos Design Language Guidelines is a modular approach to branding. By breaking down the guidelines into smaller components, it becomes easier to build and maintain a cohesive brand identity. The modularity allows for a more flexible and adaptable approach, allowing the brand to evolve as needed while maintaining consistency.

## Branching

The Logos Design Language Guidelines are based on a Master Guideline and Branching system. The Master Guideline serves as the foundational framework for branding, providing the core components and principles that guide the overall branding strategy. The Branching system allows for customization and adaptation of the Master Guideline to meet the needs of different sub-brands or applications.

The Branching system works by taking the Master Guideline and creating a new branch that can be customized as needed. The customizable components are highlighted in blue, while the non-customizable components that remain consistent across all branches are shown in black.
